<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoJo%27s_Bizarre_Adventure">Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure</a> (henceforth JJBA, or JoJo for variety) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga">manga</a> penned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirohiko_Araki">Hirohiko Araki</a>. It began publication in 1987, and is still a going concern today.</p>

<p>I think I first heard of JJBA in 2019, possibly in relation to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Disastrous_Life_of_Saiki_K.">Saiki K</a>, which contains multiple references to JoJo. The “Bizarre Adventure” part of the name sounded promising, so I googled it, and the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=jojo%27s+bizarre+adventure&amp;sxsrf=APq-WBuJ9jMZfigR8kRNcivrHGNdlvRW4A:1645516822915&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiojM7t65L2AhUPzzgGHSwBCkEQ_AUoAXoECCgQAw&amp;biw=1999&amp;bih=1332&amp;dpr=1">image results</a> revealed vivid, bewildering depictions of innumerable characters in contorted poses, all wearing outlandish costumes in jarring colours. I didn’t know what the hell I was looking at, but I liked it. For the next while, whenever I remembered JJBA I would repeat this googlage and revel in the enigmatic weirdness. Strangely, aside from some cursory wikipedia reading, I wasn’t too bothered about learning more.</p>

<p>But in early 2021 the first season of the anime adaptation turned up on Netflix, and I dived in straight away. Turns out JJBA is every bit as weird and fantastical as I’d imagined. And to tell you the truth, I’ve become a bit obsessed. I’m writing this brief survey in an effort to extirpate this fixation.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/jjba/all-smaller.jpg" alt="Image of the 8 Jojos" title="All the Jojos so far" /></p>

<h2 id="the-essence-of-jojo">The essence of JoJo</h2>

<p>The saga is split into eight parts, with each part being a mostly self-contained story featuring a member of the Joestar bloodline whose name contains two “Jo” syllables, so the titular JoJo is actually 8 different people. The stories boil down to a JoJo and his or her allies being pitted against a suitably nefarious antagonist and their allies. The first 6 parts are linked, while parts 7 &amp; 8 are set in a different universe.</p>

<p>As I understand it (from a cursory glance at Wikipedia), JJBA follows the convention of a “tournament” manga. As you might expect from the name, this genre focuses heavily on antagonists trying best each other, with much of the entertainment coming from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>combatants conducting lengthy internal monologues about strategy</li>
  <li>severe trash-talking between adversaries</li>
  <li>twists and turns in the fortunes of battle as each combatant tries to one up the other with their mad skills.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the bare-bones of the tournament genre doesn’t sound that interesting - and note that millions of wrestling fans will disagree with you - JJBA’s point of difference is to make the confrontations frequently convoluted, weird, and grotesque. Sign me up!</p>

<h1 id="the-story">The story</h1>

<p>In this section I’m going to outline synopses of the existing eight parts to give a flavour of the story.</p>

<p>There’s one thing to note before we start: Araki routinely gives characters the names of Western rock bands or performers, or their songs. How a name lands with you will depend on your appetite for whimsy, or perhaps your precise musical tastes. See what you think; we’ll come back to this subject later.</p>

</figure>

<p>The saga kicks off with the adventures of Jonathan Joestar (nicknamed Jojo, geddit?), an upper crust kid in 1880s England. He’s in conflict with his adoptive brother <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_James_Dio">Dio</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Brando">Brando</a>, a ne’er do well orphan with designs on the Joestar fortune. All is relatively mundane at first (give or take a roasted dog) until Jonathan cottons on to Dio’s nefariority complex. In desperation Dio dons a stone Aztec mask hanging around their house and is handily transformed into a vampire. Though built like a brick shithouse, Jonathan needs a supernatural power up in order to contend with Dio. Lucky then that upon realising this he immediately meets Will A. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led_Zeppelin">Zeppeli</a>, a flamboyant Italian practitioner of the art of “hamon” (sometimes translated as “ripple”): the energy of the sun a practitioner gains through controlling their breathing (apparently). The chief value of Hamon energy is that it is deadly to vampires.</p>

<p>With the aid of Zeppelli and cockney chum Robert E.O. Speedwagon (geddit??) Jojo confronts Dio and his zombie horde. Who will be victorious?</p>

<p>So I’ll grant you that all of that sounds like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_load_of_old_cobblers">cobblers</a>, but I find it to be my kind of cobblers! Nothing is done by halves: Dio is an utterly scurrilous villain, while Jojo embodies the chivalric English gentlemanliness to the point of profound tedium. (Indeed, Araki decided to move on to a new Jojo storyline because he found Jonathan too boring.) Beyond the Manichean conflict of our protagonist and antagonist there are plenty of lurid incidental details to keep the reader/viewer engaged. For example, at one point in the narrative Jonathan and chums are ambushed by zombie Jack the Ripper erupting out of the body horse. What an entrance! Meanwhile, in classic manga style, combatants announce their special moves as they perform them; Jonathan’s being the rousing “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KGHViJqTsk&amp;t=38s">SUNLIGHT YELLOW OVERDRIVE</a>!”</p>

<p>Phantom Blood is a somewhat flawed prototype for the larger JoJo saga: its charm being strictly of the “so weird it’s good” variety. Many readers skip the part altogether to get to the better stuff. But I find it so engagingly silly that I would recommend it to anyone who loves campy heroic bad-taste action.</p>

<p>After only a few months of writing Phantom Blood, Araki decided to dispatch Jonathan in a typically understated fashion (I’m kidding; it’s ridiculous!). Killing off a protagonist was unheard of in late 80’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Dnen_manga">shonen manga</a>, so Araki was taking a bit of a gamble with his readers, but happily it paid off, setting the stage for decades of periodic JoJo reinvention.</p>

<h2 id="part-2---battle-tendency-1987---1989">Part 2 - Battle Tendency (1987 - 1989)</h2>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>The aptly named Battle Tendency is a globe-trotting Indiana Jonesy adventure set in the late 1930s. The new JoJo is Jonathan’s grandson Joseph, 19, an unchivalrous, wise-cracking goof prone to running away when the chips are down (he refers to it as his “ultimate technique”). In essence he’s the anti Jonathan.</p>

<p>Extending the stone mask backstory, Joseph is pitted against the reanimated Aztec superbeing vampires known as the Pillar Men: Kars, Whammu, and Eisidesi (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cars">Cars</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wham!">Wham</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC/DC">AC/DC</a>, naturally). Aiding Joseph in this conflict are his frenemy Caesar Zeppeli (grandson of Will. A), the enigmatic Hamon instructor Lisa Lisa, and Rudol[sic] von Stroheim, a… well I’ll just say it: he’s a Nazi. (I concede this detail is a bit “problematic”, but the tone is so absurd - esp when von Stroheim becomes a cyborg with a cannon in his chest - that it seems churlish to take it seriously.)</p>

<p>So the Pillar Men, get awakened from thousands of years of slumber by those pesky Nazis, and Joseph has to train up to be a Hamon master (mostly off-screen), protect and then rescue a glowing ruby macguffin, and generally thwart the Pillar Men’s plan to become “ultimate lifeforms”. The subdued climax involves Joseph and Kars battling it out on a chunk of rock that has been ejected into space by an erupting volcano.</p>

<p>Battle Tendency is a rollicking adventure that marks a significant improvement on Phantom Blood’s schlock and awe. It’s not a perfect story, but Araki’s story-telling is more assured.</p>

<h2 id="part-3---stardust-crusaders-1989---1992">Part 3 - Stardust Crusaders (1989 - 1992)</h2>

<figure>
    <img src="/assets/jjba/jotaro.jpg" width="300" alt="Picture of Jotaro Kujo with his stand STAR PLATINUM" title="Jotaro Kujo with his stand STAR PLATINUM" />

</figure>

<p>The third JoJo outing featured some significant tweaks to the format. Bored of taking his protagonists through the plot mechanics of learning the Hamon technique, Araki invented the concept of “stands”, Hamon spirits controlled by a human user. Each stand has a unique set of reality warping qualities that can be utilised in battle. Because stands are an emergent property of their user’s personality, they come fully formed without the need of training to manifest and use them.</p>

<p>To get a better idea of how stands work you could watch a JJBA anime battle clip on YouTube, but the link I’ll toss in here is some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_g9ufxg28k">game play</a> from the entirely understated 1998 JJBA arcade game (made by the creators of Street Fighter!).</p>

<p>A further innovation with Stardust Crusaders was to leave behind the stone mask Aztec vampire “mythos” element from the saga. There is one nod to the earlier parts: the return of Dio!</p>

<p>The story: it is the late 1980s. Dio has returned after spending a century in a coffin at the bottom of the Atlantic. Worse still, he’s managed to cobble his head onto the body of Jonathan Joestar (don’t think about it too much). Additionally, his name apparently gets stuck in capslock, for he’s henceforth known as DIO. With the help of witch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enya">Enya</a> the Hag, Dio acquires a stand. And because Jonathan’s body is involved, Jonathan’s descendants (Joseph Joestar, Joseph’s daughter Holly, and her half-Japanase son Jotaro Kujo) also acquire stands. Okay then…</p>

<p>An ageing but admirably buff Joseph Joestar visits Jotaro and Holly in Japan and helps Jotaro to control his stand’s destructive and kleptomaniac tendencies. (Said stand is named STAR PLATINUM. I’ll henceforth refer to stands in caps as well, because stand users tend to portentously announce their names when deploying them, and ALL CAPS conveys the majesty of this better). Soon after, Holly falls ill because her stand is too powerful for her delicate feminine nature (apparently), and in order to save her Joseph and Jotaro must kill DIO within 50 days!</p>

<p>With this ticking clock in place, the Joestars (aided by comrades Avdol, Kakyoin, Polnareff, and later Iggy) journey to DIO’s lair in Egypt. Along the way they are ambushed by a what feels like an unending number of stand users allied to DIO. Eventually they reach Cairo and the final battle pits DIO and Jotaro <em>stando a stando</em>.</p>

<p>Stardust Crusaders was the story that boosted JJBA to wider cultural awareness in Japan, making Jotaro <em>the</em> JoJo. Dressed like a delinquent Japanese school boy, albeit one with a 30 year old’s body, Jotaro certainly looks the part. Araki based Jotaro’s demeanour on Clint Eastwood’s Dirty Harry, so he’s basically a stoic, callous, antihero grump who glowers at his surroundings with the dead eyes of a bird of prey. But all this is window-dressing; what makes Jotaro truly a rebel is that he’s frequently rude to his mum. (This must be truly thrilling to Japanese readers…)</p>

<p>I think Jotaro’s character design is perhaps Araki’s best, and he deserves his iconic status. That said, his surly nature makes him unsuitable for handling the story’s comic moments - of which there are many - so much of Stardust Crusaders’ narrative focus is given to the comical Polnareff, and the reliably entertaining Joseph Joestar. This decoupling of the narrative from the protagonist would become more prevalent in subsequent parts.</p>

<p>Despite the iconic status of Jotaro and his gang, much of Stardust Crusaders’ structure is episodic and repetitive. Over and over again Team JoJo will arrive at a new location, a stand will attack them, and the stand’s owner has to be identified, confronted, and defeated. The group moves on. Repeat. It’s not all bad: there are plenty of memorable moments in these episodes. But they sort of blur together for readers, making for a fairly significant architectural flaw.</p>

<h2 id="part-4---diamond-is-unbreakable-1992---1995">Part 4 - Diamond is Unbreakable (1992 - 1995)</h2>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>In a marked departure from the epic settings of the previous three parts, Diamond is Unbreakable (DIU)’s story is confined to the fictional Japanese seaside town of Morioh. Araki made another tweak to the broader JJBA “lore”: in Stardust Crusaders, the origin of stand abilities was left unexplained, but in DIU “standiness” is conveyed upon a person when they are pierced by a magical arrow.</p>

<p>The story: it’s the far off future of 1999, and our new Jojo is schoolboy Josuke Hishigata, the illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar. Joseph himself is now elderly and frail, so Jotaro is saddled with handling the exposition, and he isn’t happy about it. Josuke’s has a DIO-inherited stand called CRAZY DIAMOND, which has the somewhat paradoxical qualities of being able to both inflict immense violence and to heal people. (From a narrative perspective, CRAZY DIAMOND allows Araki his heroes to suffer terrible injuries and still survive. There are moments in DIU that might make you wince.)</p>

<p>The initial arc of the story sees Jotaro coming to town to protect Josuke from a stand-wielding killer. It transpires that an additional, unknown agent is going about Morioh spiking residents with a stand arrow to create a diverse array of new antagonists and allies. Once Josuke and his stand-wielding schoolfriends (Jotaro remains present but on the sidelines) have dealt with this initial swarm of villains, the central big bad of the story appears. Kira Yoshikage is a seemingly mild-mannered (if strikingly Bowie-esque) fellow who has been unobtrusively killing women in Morioh for years (with help from his sinister stand, KILLER QUEEN). Learning of Kira’s existence, Josuke and his gang set about tracking him down. Kira is careful and cunning, but how long can he stay ahead of his pursuers, and what will he do when he is finally unmasked?</p>

<p>While the preceding synopsis is greatly simplified, it demonstrates how Araki’s storytelling has become more sophisticated since Phantom Blood. But the true joy of Diamond is Unbreakable is the wealth of characters and detail Araki uses to populate Morioh. (Indeed, Araki fell in love with Morioh so much that he returned there in part 8.)</p>

<p>If Jotaro was at times slightly sidelined as the main character in Stardust Crusaders, Josuke is even more so in DIU. But this time it’s less from necessity, and more because Araki wants to explore the lives of the denizens of Morioh. In particular, much coverage is given to the travails of Josuke’s diminuitive friend Koichi, and, later in the story, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga_artist">mangaka</a> Rohan Kishibe.</p>

<p>Despite this narrative de-emphasis, Josuke is still a fleshed out character (moreso than the one-note Jotaro). In fact in some ways Josuke is the most grounded of all the JoJos. While he is imbued with typical Joestar heroism, he’s also very much a high school kid: he comes up with (very dubious) schemes for making money, and makes some questionable choices. His relationship with his estranged father Joseph is also nuanced. Eventually they’re sort of reconciled, but there’s never a sense of happily ever after. In fact the biggest satisfaction Josuke gets from the relationship is when he manages to steal Joseph’s wallet.</p>

<p>If Josuke is the most down-to-Earth JoJo, Kira is the most relatable villain. While the portrayal is hardly sympathetic, we do have opportunity to see inside Kira’s and understand him a bit better. Much time is given to Kira’s nightmarish experiences trying to evade detection and resume his quiet life.</p>

<p>It’s also worth mentioning that despite its relatively down-to-earth setting, DIU still manages to serve up the sort of sublime nonsense for which JJBA is famed. There’s the chap who is trapped inside his stand, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfly_(song)">SUPER FLY</a>, which manifests in the physical form of an electricity pylon. There’s the appearance of an apparent extraterrestrial, <a href="https://jojowiki.com/Mikitaka_Hazekura">Mikitaka Hazekura</a>, whose shapeshifting abilities are co-opted by Josuke to best Rohan at gambling. Most brain-cracking of all is when the ghost of Kira’s father, Yoshihiro Kira, entered the story. You see Yoshihiro gets trapped by Jotaro in a polaroid photo taken by Yoshihiro’s stand, a supernatural camera called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_Heart_Mother">ATOM HEART FATHER</a>. Yoshishiro manages to grab the stand arrow, and escapes when his photographic domicile gets blown away on the wind. He then goes on an arrow spiking spree in order to create new stand users that he persuades to fight Josuke and co. I cite this as an example of how the JoJo crazy can get very convoluted.</p>

<p>All up, DIU is the best JJBA story the anime has covered. In terms of quality, and with its small town vibe and psychedelic whimsy, DIU feels a bit like Araki’s equivalent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sgt._Pepper%27s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band">Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band</a> (a comparison I think he might appreciate).</p>

</figure>

<p>For the next JoJo adventure we will travel from Morioh in 1999 to Italy in 2001. But first, back to the mid 80s! While in Cairo waiting for the Stardust Crusaders to show up, DIO impregnated a Japanese woman, and the resulting issue was Giorno Giovanni. Remember that DIO was a vampire head on Jonathan Joestar’s body, so Giorno is actually Jonathan’s son, and therefore a JoJo (in this case, GioGio!). Even so, however, Giorno has DIOish blond hair, and shares DIO’s battle cry of “Muda muda muda!” (“useless useless useless!”). So is Giorno a goodie or a baddie?</p>

<p>On to 2001. Jotaro learns of Giorno’s existence, and dispatches poor little Koichi to Naples to ascertain if Giorno is good or evil. After getting off on the wrong foot with Giorno, Koichi eventually determines that Giorno is benign, and promptly exits the story to allow Giorno to take centre stage.</p>

<p>As a Joestar, Giorno is automatically entitled to a stand, and his is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gold_Experience">GOLD EXPERIENCE</a>. It comes with the power to transmute objects into living matter (small animals, plants, etc), making him, like Josuke, both a dealer of damage and a medic.</p>

<p>At the start of the story Giorno is operating in Naples as a thief, but he, Giorno, has a dream: to break up the Neapolitan drug-dealing mafia gang known as “Passione”, by taking out its enigmatic Boss.</p>

<p>Giorno has a run in with junior mafioso Bruno Bucciarati (stand: STICKY FINGERS, haircut: bowl) and their battle goes so well that not only does Giorno win, but he manages to co-opt Bucchiarati to his cause. Giorno joins Bucciarati’s mafia unit, La Squadra. Soon after the gang get assigned to protect the Boss’s daughter Trish (eventual stand: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice_Girls">SPICE GIRL</a>). Bucciaratti delivers Trish to the Boss, but trouble breaks out, and the gang is forced to go on the run with all of Passione trying to murder them. The final confrontation occurs in the Colisseum (which you’ll recall is also where the Pillar Men in part 2 were excavated). Passione’s Boss is revealed to be the dastardly Diavolo, whose fearsome stand <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Crimson">KING CRIMSON</a> can undo the causation of events affecting him. Who will prevail??</p>

<p>Golden Wind is Araki’s homage to both Italy and mafia dramas. 15-year old Giorno is modelled on Michelangelo’s David (if David wore a braided ponytail and sported three pastry rolls on his forehead). The story can be summed up as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodfellas">Goodfellas</a> with stands, which at face value is a winning premise.</p>

<p>Sadly Golden Wind turns out to be the weakest of the JoJo parts I’ve consumed so far. There are two critical flaws. The first is that Giorno’s character is very flat. He’s not got Joseph’s chutzpah, Jotaro’s flintiness, or Josuke’s charm. Even Jonathan Joestar has more personality. In fact Giorno is overshadowed in his own story by La Squadra’s other members, especially Bucciarati. In fact even standard-issue, damsel-in-distress Trish gets more development.</p>

<p>The second flaw is that the climax of Golden Wind is muddled and confusing. It’s ok for a reader to be slightly baffled at a JoJo ending, but you should be grinning with delight, rather than frowning in confusion.</p>

<p>Golden Wind’s narrative may have some flaws, but the situation is not all bad. The character designs are some of Araki’s most out-there creations, the stand fights are some of the most compelling in all of JJBA, and Diavolo is another interesting villain. Nevertheless it’s notable that while each part in the series had improved on the last, Golden Wind marks the first dip in quality.</p>

<p>To sum up, I would say that if DIU was Araki’s Sgt. Pepper, Golden Wind is very much his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles_(album)">White Album</a>. But I feel obliged to point out that Golden Wind is very popular among Western fans of JJBA, so my opinion may be very much in the minority.</p>

<h2 id="part-6---stone-ocean-1999---2003">Part 6 - Stone Ocean (1999 - 2003)</h2>

<figure>
    <img src="/assets/jjba/jolyne.jpg" width="300" alt="Picture of Jolyne Kujo" title="Jolyne Cujo" />

</figure>

<p>Until part 6, JJBA’s female characters were few in number and seldom well-realised. Part 1’s Erina was girlfriend-by-numbers, and part 2’s Lisa Lisa was a badass femme fatale, but didn’t rise much beyond noir cliche. As for Stardust Crusaders, it was largely female free, save for Jotaro’s feeble mother Holly and the wicked crone Enyaba. DIU had more female characters: particularly the frighteningly possessive Yukako Yamagishi and ghost girl Reimi Sugimoto, but again their roles were more peripheral to the frankly sausage-heavy core cast.</p>

<p>It’s true that shonen comics tend to be very masculine in their focus, but Araki was clearly capable of better, and with part 6 he finally delivered. Stone Ocean gives us our first lady JoJo, Jolyne Kujo. Araki further upped the female focus by setting the story in the women’s wing of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Green_Dolphin_Street_(song)">Green Dolphin Street</a> prison, providing Jolyne with some female sidekicks. I should be careful here: strictly speaking one sidekick is a colony of zooplankton (pronouns unknown), but they(?) pass as female.</p>

<p>The premise: it’s 2011 and Jolyne Kujo is framed for a crime she didn’t commit! When sentenced to many years in prison, her estranged daddy Jotaro helps out as only he can: by giving her part of a stand arrow to pierce herself with so that she can obtain a stand. (The more astute of you may be wondering why she doesn’t automatically have a “Joestar” stand. Well, she was born after DIO got his stand and transmitted standiness to Jonathan’s descendents, so she missed out.) Once in possession of her stand, STONE FREE, Jolyne can protect herself in prison. After Jotaro is left grievously injured in a prison visit gone very wrong, Jolyne is faced with needing to save her father, unmask the secret villain behind the assassination attempt, and escape from Green Dolphin Street Prison.</p>

<p>At time of writing only 12 episodes of the Stone Ocean anime have been released, so I can’t give even a cursory outline of the full narrative (self-spoilers, jeez!). But so far the story is very much a return to form after Golden Wind (so let’s say it’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey_Road">Abbey Road</a>). The narrative focus is tight, the stakes are high, the peril is immediate and constant, and Jolyne’s motivations are clear. I’m looking forward to finding out what happens next.</p>

<p>I don’t know much more about the rest of the Stone Ocean plot except that it concludes the wider Joestar saga.</p>

<h2 id="part-7---steel-ball-run-2005---2011">Part 7 - Steel Ball Run (2005 - 2011)</h2>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>After Stone Ocean Araki reset the narrative timeline, and Parts 7 and 8 occur in a different universe. Steel Ball Run is a retelling of Jonathan Joestar’s story, except with the premise scrambled.</p>

<p>We’re back in 1888 and Johnny Joestar is a paraplegic jockey understandably down on his luck. He meets Gyro Zeppeli (this part’s Will. A. Zeppeli), who possesses “steel balls” (literally, this isn’t a euphemism…) which Johnny believes can cure his paraplegia. Johnny then tags along with Gyro in a horse race across the USA called the Steel Ball Run (clearly a reference to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burt_Reynolds">Burt Reynolds</a> “classic” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cannonball_Run">The Cannonball Run</a>).</p>

<p>And that’s all I know really; at time of writing there is as yet no anime adaptation. That said, I’m tempted to actually read the manga rather than wait two years for the next anime because SBR’s premise sounds kind of fun. Even more compelling than the story is the character design. Gyro Zeppelli, gotten up like a catwalk cowboy (in a cape!), is perhaps Araki’s coolest character design. Meanwhile Johnny, in his sky blue jockey silks and horseshoe-emblazoned cap, looks somewhere between a gypsy fortune teller and a 1930s Hollywood starlet.</p>

<p>What do we make of Araki’s decision to reboot the saga? Normally for this to happen in a comic (see endless Batman/Superman/Spiderman reboots) it’s a sign of the hero’s story running out of creative steam. To my mind reboots dilute the story by making it a bit whatever you want it to be.</p>

<p>So SBR could be seen as that, but I think the impetus for the reboot is as simple as Araki wanting to set his next JoJo story in the Wild West, and setting it outside the existing JJBA continuity is the most plausible way to achieve this. Additionally it appears Johnny is only a very loose analogue of Jonathan, so it’s not so much an alternative past as a completely new story. In short, I think the SBR reboot is a reasonable way to keep telling more JoJo stories.</p>

<p>Jojolion is the SBR universe equivalent of DIU. I know even less about Jojolion than SBR. The protagonist, who is also called Josuke Higishigata as in DIU, wears a sailor suit and trainers. Sadly, his stand is not called New York, New York…</p>

<p>Once again the look is amazing. And that’s all I can say of the story until it gets an anime adaptation in approximately four years.</p>

<p>SBR posed the question “why reboot?”; Jojolion makes me wonder “why return to Morioh?”, especially if the first time round is the high point of the manga. It would be justified if the story Araki wanted to tell is a good one, but if not, Jojolion is just a creative retread.</p>

<h2 id="part-9---jojolands">Part 9 - Jojolands?</h2>

<p>Jojolion was concluded in 2021, and Araki is currently developing a new part, provisionally called Jojolands. There’s not much more to say about this part other than to watch this space.</p>

<h2 id="the-future">The future</h2>

<p>The meme that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitPostCrusaders/comments/f483qj/araki_the_vampire_this_man_just_doesnt_want_to_age/">Araki is immortal</a> notwithstanding, the great man is in his 60s now, and given Jojolion took 10 years to complete, part 9 may well be the last JJBA part before he retires.  Alterntatively, in recent years Araki has handed out the keys to other mangaka to produce spinoff JoJo stories, and this suggests the possibility of a post-Araki life for JJBA. Would that life be interesting without Araki’s genius? I would say almost certainly not, but a mangaka of similar talent could make a good go of it.</p>

<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>

<p>Now you have a bit of a handle on the story, I’m going to make some commentary on the JoJo phenomenon. It’s going to be a bit scattershot, but will hopefully provide the reader with some entertainment.</p>

<h2 id="the-anime">The anime</h2>

<p>The anime adaptation by David Productions is about as good as you could hope for. There’s an assurance in the presentation, and care taken to present the heritage of JJBA with the respect it deserves. As will be apparent with the lengthy music discussion below, a lot of effort was put into the score. I think this will be the definitive JJBA adaptation (its only other competition being the 1990s adaptation of Stardust Crusaders).</p>

<p>At times the faithfulness of the adaptation is almost a detriment to the animation. The pacing of season 1, featuring two parts in 26 episodes, is brisk and lively compared to the interminable slog of the 48 episodes of season 2 (the entirety of Stardust Crusaders). While seasons 3 and 4 (DiU and Golden Wind) were pared back to 39 episodes apiece, these seasons too are bit mushier (in my mind at least) than season 1.</p>

<h2 id="arakis-visual-style">Araki’s visual style</h2>

<p>Araki is very much into fashion and art, in particular Italian Renaissance art (which may explain the almost sculptural visual sensibility of JJBA - or to put it more plainly, all that <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/jojos-pose">JoJo posing</a>).</p>

<p>The art style of JJBA has consistently evolved since 1987. Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency weren’t too visually <em>oeutre</em>,  at least compared to later works, though Araki provided highly baroque covers for the JJBA manga volumes of the time, which hinted at a desire to bust out some crazy. The character designs in Stardust Crusaders were much more distinctive, and a further quantum shift happened with Diamond is Unbreakable. The musclebound physiques of the early JoJo parts slimmed down considerably, and the facial designs became more stylised.</p>

<p>Araki went to an extreme of outlandishness with Golden Wind, before reining it in somewhat with Stone Ocean. Steel Ball Run saw a move to a softer, more austere style, especially with characters’ faces. In fact you could argue that since 2005 every character in JJBA has had the same face: blank eyes, lips pouting, expressionless and seemingly unknowable. Goodies and baddies alike could appear on a Vogue cover. These stares have a feel of otherworldly contemplation, if you want to state it charitably; but there’s also a dehumanising quality, like looking at a collection of automatons. I can’t deny that it’s an intriguing look, but it feels like a creative dead end, a point beyond which there’s nowhere further to evolve. I hope that JoJolands will mark another visual reinvention; the question is, can old dog Araki learn new tricks?</p>

<h1 id="music">Music</h1>

<p>I’m going to ramble about a series of music-related topics with which JJBA intersects.</p>

<h2 id="musical-character-names">Musical character names</h2>

<p>As mentioned earlier, Araki habitually names characters (or their stands) after Western rock groups, and more often than not the effect of this - for me at least - is both jarring and amusing. One early example: Jonathan Joestar and friends get confronted by a reanimated medieval knight named Bruford (“Bluford”, technically, see Localisation below). Now “Bruford” is an English name, but if you’re already aware of names like “Speedwagon” and “Dio”, you’ll conclude that it’s a reference to Bill Bruford, drummer of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Crimson">King Crimson</a>.</p>

<p>Araki’s musical taste is apparently very eclectic, with JJBA characters or stands named after musical acts as disparate as <a href="https://jojowiki.com/Mariah">Mariah Carey</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steely_Dan">Steely Dan</a>, <a href="https://jojowiki.com/Straizo">Dire Straits</a>, the <a href="https://jojowiki.com/Sex_Pistols">Sex Pistols</a>, and <a href="https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/Smokey_Brown">Smokey Robinson</a>. Some names suggest impeccable taste, while others are kind of laughable: Stardust Crusaders’ penultimate antagonist is a formidable opponent underwhelmingly named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla_Ice">Vanilla Ice</a>. (Though the situation is somewhat redeemed by said antagonist’s stand being called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream_(band)">CREAM</a>.)</p>

<p>What is the meaning of all this?! On the one hand this naming convention feels arbitrary, like Araki just went through an encyclopaedia of rock and used names at random. I have no reason to believe that he actually did this, but the effect is largely the same.</p>

<p>Quibbles aside, Araki’s musical naming convention is at least kind of fun when he names stands after <a href="https://jojowiki.com/Kraft_Work">bands I like at least</a>. And he does manage to make the Queen song <a href="https://jojowiki.com/Killer_Queen">Killer Queen</a> sinister, which is quite an achievement. That said, I’m disappointed there’s no ABBA or BEEGEES. Perhaps something for part 9?</p>

<h3 id="localisation">Localisation</h3>

<p>The strangeness of Araki’s musical naming convention is taken to a higher power via the practice of “localisation”, where the English translation of a manga/anime name referring to real world entities are “subtly” renamed, in an effort to avoid copyright problems. The renaming can be as simple as using the Japanese transliteration of the non-Japanese name. For example, Wham becomes “Wammu”. But at other times, an alternative name is used. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Santana">Santana</a>, a character in Battle Tendency, is renamed “San Viento” in the manga/anime. Jolyne’s stand STONE FREE is renamed Stone Ocean.</p>

<p>But sometimes the results of localisation changes are unintentionally funny. One that sticks in my head (because the change is almost antithetical to the original) is the stand named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraftwerk">KRAFTWORK</a>, which gets localised to “Arts and Crafts”. The most humorously awful localisation change, by quite some margin, is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Deeds_Done_Dirt_Cheap">DIRTY DEEDS DONE DIRT CHEAP</a> (a moniker given to a Steel Ball Run stand), which localisation mutates to “Filthy acts, at a reasonable price”.</p>

<h2 id="the-anime-soundtracks">The Anime soundtracks</h2>

<h3 id="original-music">Original music</h3>

<p>The chief joy of the Phantom Blood arc of the anime’s first season is opening theme “<a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=R2Be4YJTORw">Sono Chi no Sadame</a>”, a rollicking piece of theatrical rock, featuring some fearsome tenor bellowing. The song feels very old fashioned, going not just back to JJBA’s 80s’s origins, but earlier still. If it was a western production I’d say the song’s over the top tone was intended to be tongue in cheek, but I’m not sure if that’s the actually the case here. In any event: hell of a song.</p>

<p>Battle Tendency’s soundtrack was composed by Taku Iwasaki and features some EDM numbers like “Welcome to the World” and “Overdrive”, as well as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qawwali">Qawwali</a> dubstep of fan-favourite <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNJmVJwkJwk">“Awake”</a>. The opening theme for the part is the unpleasantly-named but otherwise genial “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcuTPjgMiXw">Bloody Stream</a>” which complements the irreverant tone of Battle Tendency very nicely.</p>

<p>The score for subsequent seasons of JJBA (so far at least) have been composed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugo_Kanno">Yugo Kanno</a>. I think it’s fair to say that Kanno has made Jojo soundtracks definitively his own. Supremely eclectic, his musical style can be roughly described as “everything”. The musical recipe: take elements of metal, hiphop, and dubstep, and then drop a jazz orchestra on top of them. While the catchy “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EP62gl-sj2I">Golden Wind</a>” has taken on a life of its own in TikTok memes, I think Kanno’s triumph is the uneasy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yGGNohmAT0">Kira’s theme</a> from Part 4.</p>

<p>The last original soundtrack pieces I want to highlight are the first and third opening songs for DIU. The first, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20m00ohYASw">Crazy, Noisy, Bizarre Town</a>”, is a charmingly enthusiastic J disco sort of song. In something of a contrast, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VeYP98UT-g">Great Days</a>” is a kind of psychedelic soul number. These songs tell us all we need to know about DIU’s contrast in style to earlier parts. In fact you couldn’t come up with a greater contrast to the wonderfully hyper macho opening themes for Stardust Crusaders (“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLwuQwKs4yA">Stand Proud</a>” and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJBDHvznWs">End of the World</a>”, which, by the way, are also great).</p>

</figure>

<p>To my mind the opening songs for Golden Wind and Stone Ocean aren’t quite as strong as earlier seasons, but that’s perhaps because I find their styles less engaging.</p>

<h3 id="end-credit-songs">End credit songs</h3>

<p>I read somewhere that Araki personally chose the music for the end credits of each of the JJBA series. Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency used <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUyTmUwEUy8">Roundabout</a> by Yes. Although I consider myself a man of some musical learning I confess I wasn’t familiar with the song, and amusingly assumed that it was by some sort of contemporary Japanese prog rock band. (Well, it’s not implausible!) The frenetic energy of Roundabout is an excellent choice though, esp to visuals blood flowing from Aztec sacrifices - yikes! Amusingly, the episode-end “To Be Continued” motif (inherited from the manga) combined with Roundabout became a <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/yes-roundabout-to-be-continued">meme</a> for innumerable internet videos in the mid-2010s.</p>

<p>For the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV_CwCTOOMI">end titles of the first half of Stardust Crusaders</a> Araki chose the Bangles’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk_Like_an_Egyptian">Walk Like an Egyptian</a>. I hadn’t thought about that song for more than 30 years, but I was elated at how perfectly it fit with the Crusaders’ Egyptian destination, and the surreal whimsy of JJBA generally. In keeping with the in-joke that <a href="https://www.quora.com/Who-is-JoJo-and-why-is-everything-a-reference-to-him">Everything is a JoJo reference</a>, it now almost feels to me like the song was written for JJBA.</p>

<p>For the second half of Stardust Crusaders, the credits featured Last Train Home by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Metheny_Group">Pat Methany Group</a>. This “smooth” jazz fusion piece might seem like an odd choice for Stardust Crusaders, but the result feels oddly poignant, esp when casualties start to mount at the end of the story.</p>

<p>For DIU, Araki chose I Need You by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savage_Garden">Savage Garden</a>. I remember gritting my teeth at that song when it came out, but I tell you what, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxrrx_XRlyw">against the dayglow pop-art style of DIU</a>, the song works brilliantly.</p>

<p>Sadly, my approval of Araki’s choices plummets with the end credits songs for Golden Wind and Stone Ocean. Whether you agree or not depends on how you feel about the following:</p>

</table>

<p>It’s probably a function of my age, but for me these songs have next to no resonance.</p>

<h1 id="the-infinite-jojo-meme-factory">The infinite JoJo meme factory</h1>

<p>If the musical facets of JJBA are a bit of a tangle, the memery Araki’s work inspires is so convoluted not even a topologist could make sense of it. The surreal imagery and hard-boiled dialogue of the manganime is tailor-made out-of-context gifs. There’s rather too many examples to catalogue exhaustively, so I’ll content myself listing a few examples of which I am very fond.</p>

<h2 id="mmd-vids">MMD vids</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MikuMikuDance">MikuMikuDance</a> is a piece of Japanese software that allows users to animate characters dancing in a 3d space. Unsurprisingly there are JJBA character models available, YouTube features innumerable MMD vids of JJBA characters dancing to various songs (lots of different kinds, but K-pop features a lot). The first one I saw was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkZKoc0EwEU">straightforward, and oddly elegaic</a>, but there are some that are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL1qlNtdVy4">very silly</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l1MBNgXLr4">one</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHvLXNngV4w">two</a> that are arguably better than the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VTkBuxU4yk">videos they’re based on</a>.</p>

<p>There’s obviously much enjoyment to be had watching a bunch of implausible characters dancing with impossible synchrony (well, with synchrony impossible outside of North Korea, anyway). But to my mind the MMD JoJo videos truly come into their own when they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNJmVJwkJwk">go off-piste and off the rails</a>. Here’e a trilogy of MMD “skits” that sum up the first three JJBA parts remarkably well:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPYoyg4Ozrc">phantom_blood.mp4</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPYoyg4Ozrc">battle_tendency.mp4</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv8TbnZFa3s">stardust_crusaders.mp4</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="other-amusing-youtube-jojo-appearences">Other amusing YouTube JoJo appearences</h2>

<p>Youtube (and doubtless other places too, but I’m too old to use them) has dense thickets of JoJo parodies. Some are very well animated, like this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgshWn6edn8">simultaneously reverant and slightly irritating example</a>. Then there’s this series mashing up JJBA and Pokemon:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OESzV-MGHYM">Part 1</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V718G75BH4A">Part 2</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYa0AgJ85xY">Part 3</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If JJBA and Pokemon seem to integrate rather too seamlessly, it’s because Pokemon’s concept - opponents battling using proxy supernatural organisms - is very similar to JJBA’s stands. JJBA came first, but I don’t know whether JoJo directly influenced Pokemon.</li>
  <li>These examples make fun of the Araki’s musical naming convention by using the names of mediocre or one-hit groups familiar to millenials, such as SMASHMOUTH, P.O.D., and ATOMIC KITTEN (upgraded to PUSSYCAT DOLLS). <em>chef’s kiss</em></li>
</ul>

<p>There are also - of course - a large number of uncreative JoJo reaction and commentary videos, none worth highlighting save for  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk02Uuex2js">this guy</a> who watched all 43 episodes of Stardust Crusaders in one increasingly nightmarish sitting.</p>

<p>What else? Here’s:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3TjMx_pwU">woman risking musculoskeletal catastrophe</a> performing a series of JoJo poses.</li>
  <li>Jotaro and DIO’s confrontation re-edited so that they’re playing UNO (there’s also one where Joseph plays connect 4 with villain D’Arby the Elder)</li>
  <li>a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Lddkd4vTM">compilation of Engrish speech in JJBA</a>. Laughing at Engrish is perhaps poor form, but in this case it feels like the JJBA voice actors were deliberately hamming it up. I dunno, you decide.</li>
</ul>

<p>What am I trying to convey with this scattershot aggregation? I’d like to say this all summed to something profound, but really I’m just sharing a bunch of vids I like. But I may as well suggest that these videos demonstrate that JJBA provides material of sufficient richness that fans can pick it up and run with it, with results that frequently rival the source “text” for entertainment value. JJBA is hardly the only “property” to get this sort of treatment, but I would rather watch fan-created JoJo material than fan-created Star Wars material. Oh my word yes.</p>

<h1 id="my-favourite-part-and-jojo">My favourite part and JoJo</h1>

<p>To my mind (and I suspect to most others’) the best JoJo part is Diamond is Unbreakable, but my favourite is Battle Tendency. DiU is unquestionably more sophisticated, but I find Battle Tendency more <em>fun</em>. I concede that picking a Hamon-era JJBA story as my favourite is a bit of a hipster move, but that’s how I feel.</p>

<p>It’s not so surpising then that my favourite JoJo is Battle Tendency’s Joseph Joestar. But I like him not so much for his cocky antics in that part, but for his hilarious goings on in Parts III and IV. I’d go into detail, but this compilation of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-3GOo_nWoc">Joseph screaming in Engrish</a> at the absurdist horror he faces encapsulates what I like about him.</p>

<p>For what it’s worth Araki reckons Josuke (not sure if part IV Josuke or part VIII Josuke) is his favourite. And for all that I’ve banged on about Joseph there’s probably thousands of fans who think that insipid (to me at least) Giorno is the best. It all sums to a shrug, really.</p>

<h1 id="an-attempt-to-sum-it-all-up">An attempt to sum it all up</h1>

<p>What can we conclude about JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure? It’s:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a thing that exists</li>
  <li>style over substance - but putting it glibly - the style <em>is</em> the substance</li>
  <li>so absurd (in my mind, if no one else’s) that it gives me a kind of existential solace</li>
  <li>a lot of silly, goofy fun.</li>
