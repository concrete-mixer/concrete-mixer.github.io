  <section class="post-content"><p>I last updated this blog in December 2015. In 2016 my time was rather swamped by work and fatherhood, but I tinkered away now and then and undertook some major work toward the end of last year. The result of this is Concrète Mixer 2.0, and this post outlines what’s changed.</p>

<h1 id="the-audio-is-much-the-same">The audio is much the same</h1>

<p>Firstly, the least impressive bit: the audio rendering is much the same as before. Some new processing has been added to playSound, and some tweaks to playFx have been made here and there, but there’s not too much different. I have other ideas but most of the effort has been aimed at refactoring the app to make it more stable and (frankly) sane.</p>

<h1 id="no-more-perl">No more Perl</h1>

<p>The biggest change is that there’s no Perl wrapper for the app. Instead, the prior Perl functionality is now written in ChucK.</p>

<p>This change was facilitated by my discovery that ChucK has FileIO and regular expression libraries which I can read and parse the config file. I’m a bit rueful I didn’t discover these libs earlier, although to be fair neither of them is documented on the ChucK website.</p>

<h1 id="hello-python---soundcloud-support">Hello Python - Soundcloud support</h1>

<p>Even as I dispensed with Perl, I had an idea to add SoundCloud support, and decided to write this in Python.</p>

<p>For a while I’d thought that Soundcloud support for users could point the app at a Soundcloud playlists might be handy. This functionality has been added in 2.0, and works pretty well. There’s support for most sound codecs via lib-avconc (aka ffmpeg). Soundcloud support makes evaluation of the app easier, and the default <code class="highlighter-rouge">concrete.conf.sample</code> points to some demo playlists.</p>

<h1 id="concrte-mixer-in-docker">Concrète Mixer in Docker</h1>

<p>I’ve decided to remove the compiled binary and selected chugins from the CM distribution - it wasn’t really appropriate to sling binaries in a github repo, and it’s certainly easier to get users to compile ChucK themselves. However this means that a prospective user now needs to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>compile ChucK</li>
  <li>compile chugins</li>
  <li>install supporting Python libs (incl virtualenv)</li>
  <li>pip install requirements.txt (for soundcloud functionality)</li>
</ul>

<p>…which is quite an ask. As a response to this, I’ve built a <a href="https://github.com/concrete-mixer/cm-docker-rpi-dac">Docker image</a> which installs all these prerequisites and kicks of CM execution. This image is built with Raspbian to run on a pi (preferably Pi3).</p>

<h1 id="concrte-mixer-as-an-internet-radio-station">Concrète Mixer as an internet radio station</h1>

<p>Finally, I’ve made <a href="https://github.com/concrete-mixer/cm-docker-rpi-internet">another Docker image</a> which augments Concrète Mixer with <a href="http://www.darkice.org">Darkice</a> and <a href="https://www.icecast.org">Icecast</a> to create a Concrète Mixer radio station. Despite the extra processing this seems to run well on a Pi3. You can hear the result <a href="http://concrete-mixer.venturus.io/concrete-mixer.mp3">here</a>.</p>

<h1 id="things-to-come">Things to come</h1>

<p>The development of 2.0 has tidied up a lot of ugliness in the original build and suggest a way forward for the future.</p>

<h2 id="near-term---radio-concrte">Near term - Radio Concrète</h2>

<p>I’ve always had a question mark in my head over how punters would use Concrète Mixer, who they would be and why they would want to use it. As an occasional sound recordist who likes mashing up audio, the use case seems obvious to me, and I guess there are others who might be keen, but whether they’d want little boxes to do it or not is still unknown to me.</p>

<p>Instead, Concrète Mixer as an internet radio station seems like a good focus to the project. The way forward seems to me to be to get more sounds. At the moment I have a half hour long battery of sounds, and that gets repetitive after a while. So I’ll go on the hunt.</p>

<h2 id="longer-term">Longer term</h2>

<p>There’s still a lot that could be done on the audio front:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The effects chain is still mono (well fake stereo by the cheat of adding a short delay to a randomly chosen channel)</li>
  <li>I have some more sound mashing ideas on playback that I haven’t explored yet. Some of these ideas (eg stereo reverb) will have to wait until more powerful iterations of rpis are available.</li>
</ul>
