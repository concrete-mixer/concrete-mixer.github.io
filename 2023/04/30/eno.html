    <p>I’ve pondered Eno a lot. The only musician who had as varied a time in the 1970s was Bowie - indeed it seemed inevitable that the two would end collaborating. By my count, and by dim memory of his excellent biography, from 1971 - 1982 he:</p>

<ul>
  <li>co-founded Roxy Music and played a big part in glam rock</li>
  <li>went solo, producing two weird glam rock albums</li>
  <li>kept bumping into Robert Fripp and producing albums with him</li>
  <li>invented ambient music after being in a car crash</li>
  <li>joined some obscure Germans on a musical commune and stole their secrets</li>
  <li>collaborated with Bowie on two of the latter’s best albums</li>
  <li>spent some time staying in a brothel in Thailand (one of many eye-popping details in the biography)</li>
  <li>went to New York for a music and artistic renaissance, and produced several Talking Heads albums</li>
  <li>collaborated on an album with David Byrne that anticipated sample-centric music later in the 1980s</li>
  <li>completed his finest album, On Land.</li>
</ul>

<p>I guess some would argue that the real highlight came after that, when he produced U2. I imagine that’s when things got super lucrative for him, but his creative peak had passed. What a peak though! What follows is a survey of the works that I think are most interesting.</p>

<h1 id="here-come-the-warm-jets-1973">Here Come the Warm Jets (1973)</h1>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2SWrIB75vc8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>After learning that Eno’s first two albums were glam rock, I didn’t bother to seek them out for many years. When I did hear them I found them much more enjoyable than his later 70s rock albums (especially the slightly uninspired Before and After Science). Here come the warm jets is an absolute romp. My favourites are Pawpaw Negro Blowtorch (a title that sure hasn’t aged well) and Baby’s on Fire. The backend of the album hints at ambient forays to come. Kind of reminds me of Rocky Horror.</p>

<h1 id="another-green-world-1975">Another Green World (1975)</h1>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bNwhtnaoVZU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>This was only a year after the Here Come the Warm Jets’ equally glam successor Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy), but stylistically it’s worlds away. About half the album consists of songs, though fairly subdued ones, while the other half is a collection of ambientish instrumentals. Another Green World is widely viewed as Eno’s finest rock album, but for me it’s a little bit in no-man’s land, neither rock nor ambient. Now normally something stuck between genre cracks is my kind of thing, but with Another Green World I get a feeling of a lack of confidence. Or perhaps rather I note the absence of confidence compared to Here Come the Warm Jets, or the later ambient On Land.</p>

<p>And yet, interestingly, there is a curious continuity. The latter songs on Here Comes the Warm Jets have a more contemplative tone, while David Bowie’s Low and Heroes albums (collaborations with Eno) feature predominantly instrumental second sides. So even if Another Green World doesn’t settle on an identity, it’s part of an increasingly successful <em>tradtion</em> for Eno.</p>

<h1 id="discreet-music-1975">Discreet Music (1975)</h1>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bNwhtnaoVZU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>I bang on about liking ambient music, but if you take ambient as being Eno’s strict formulation (music as ignorable as it is listenable), I really don’t. Discreet Music is the first album of intentionally ambient music, and - to me at least - it’s not very good. The album’s first half is a series of tape loops that hint at a musical structure or point, without ever having one. The slow speed (re)arrangements of Pachelbel’s Canon on side two is even drearier than the original (which is saying something). Discreet Music’s significance today is merely as being a step towards much better things. I’ve seen Discreet Music described as a “classic” album, but I’m just not having that.</p>

<h1 id="cluster-and-eno-1977">Cluster and Eno (1977)</h1>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4-W2r7aNtUc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>I bought this album in 1998 and on first listen absolutely hated it. I don’t think I really got it until maybe ten years later. Looking back now, I’m not sure what my problem with it was. I have a dim feeling it wasn’t what I was expecting, and it was just a bit banal. I don’t think that any longer; I think it’s an exceptional album. (Eno’s follow up with Cluster, After the Heat, is also very good.)</p>

<h1 id="heroes-1977">Heroes (1977)</h1>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TFLLE8LPA_k" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Eno collaborated with Bowie on the latter’s albums Low, Heroes, and Lodger. Low and Heroes are pretty close, quality-wise. I happen to prefer Heroes because its second side is flawless, though side 1 of Low is stronger than side 1 of Heroes (the song Heroes notwithstanding). (Is it sacrilege to say I prefer Sense of Doubt over Warszawa?)</p>

<p>Much has been made of the influence of Krautrock on the Berlin trilogy. The change of style from Station to Station to Low suggests <em>something</em> happened, but the resulting music doesn’t bear a lot of stylistic resemblence to Krautrock. I feel the influence is on a firmer footing vis-a-vis the have-a-go spirit of the albums’ production.</p>

<h1 id="music-for-films-1978">Music for Films (1978)</h1>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/40V2omQoEW8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Music for Films is a collection of remixed offcuts from Eno’s rock albums packaged (perhaps a little cynically) as potential film music. As unpromising as this collection sounds, I have to say Music for Films is my favourite Eno album. I wouldn’t say it’s his best, but it is one I enjoy without reservation.</p>

<p>I first heard music from Music for Films on a film (or rather documentary) about journeying to Timbuktu (which I was astonished to learn was an actual place). The credits referred to Music for Films by Brian Eno. I’m not sure if Eno’s name registered at the time, but when I did get hold of the album four years later, I recognised the tunes, so I guess they made quite an impact on me. They remind me of dim, remote, strange preschool memories I have.</p>

<p>I think the secret to my enjoyment of Music for Films is that the tracks are often pared back rock arrangements, with more intent than Discreet Music or its more successful (but to me still dull) successor, Music for Airports.</p>

<h1 id="my-life-in-the-bush-of-ghosts-1981">My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (1981)</h1>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W9WUT4FD9-g" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Eno’s collaboration with David Byrne is pretty astonishing, all funky whirl and American weirdness. It’s widely considered influential, but I feel the record is pretty singular. It’s not like you can see the imprint of the album on the work of others in the same way you do with Kraftwerk on Afrika Bambaata or Cybotron. You could argue there’s a resemblance to Cabaret Voltaire’s mid-80s sampler-driven work, but you can equally argue that Cabaret Voltaire simply influenced by Cabaret Voltaire.</p>

<p>By denying that My Life in the Bush of Ghosts was an influence, I’m not denigrating the album. Instead I reckon it’s brilliant in its own terms, and sufficiently original that nothing I’ve heard has come close to emulating it.</p>

<h1 id="ambient-4-on-land-1982">Ambient 4: On Land (1982)</h1>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DRiNpVslI_c" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>In case you’re not up to speed, Ambient 1 was Music for Airports, Ambient 2 was Eno’s first somewhat high GI collab with Harold Budd, Ambient 3 was the aptly named Day of Radiance, an album of performances by the dulcimer player Laraaji with Eno slopping on layers of Eno in the background. Ambient 4 finds Eno again tinkering with fragments of old recordings, repeating the formula of Music for Films. The outcome is an atmospheric and introspective work that is the most satisfying of Eno’s ambient albums. (It’s worth pointing out that with the exception of Music for Airports, the ambient series isn’t particularly ambient in Eno’s original Discreet Music conception of the idea. However Eno would return to the origin with the extremely tedious Thursday Afternoon in 1984.)</p>

<h1 id="the-pearl-1984">The Pearl (1984)</h1>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8WGx5z9wVNY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>This was Eno’s second collaboration with Harold Budd, and one which is more satisfying to me. Beautifully clear, and sustains a beautiful mood.</p>

<h1 id="getting-it-right-second-time">Getting it right second time</h1>

<p>One thing I’ve noticed writing this survey is that Eno has on several occasions iterated collaborations across several goes, usually to victory. Examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Collaboration with Robert Fripp: No pussyfooting - no good; Evening Star, much better</li>
  <li>Collaboration with Harold Budd: Plateaux of Mirror - cloying; The Pearl, on the money</li>
  <li>Ambient: Discreet Music feeble, Music for Airports better, On Land best</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of other repeat encounters include Bowie, Cluster, Talking Heads/David Byrne, U2, and even his Roxy Music career, in retrospect.</p>

<p>A more common trajectory with musicians is that they evolve to an artistic peak, which then delivers diminishing results. Eno managed to multitask his way through several peaks: glam rock, ambient, “Cluster &amp; Eno”, “Bowie”, and “Talking Heads”. That’s a tremendous achievement. He did eventually run out of steam in the mid 1980s, but that doesn’t diminish what went before.</p>

<p>It’s clear from Eno’s career that he enjoyed working with others - repeatedly, if he found them interesting enough - and this need led to a pattern of repetition that lead to reliably improved results. Hindsight would suggest that it’s a philosophy of “if at first you don’t succeed, try again”, but I don’t think Eno would have thought No Pussyfooting or Discreet Music as failures, either at the time or now. I’d say that perhaps the main takeaway is that gregariousness plus workaholism meant success would always be inevitable for him.</p>

<p>Eno described himself as a non musician, but clearly his non-abilities as a performer haven’t held him back. His art-school adaptability probably served him better than being able to produce guitar licks, allowing him to be at times a flamboyant glam provacateur, ambient boffin, and studio guru. (I suspect his interactions with Editions E.G. probably constituted an “executive producer” role too.)</p>

<h1 id="the-process">The Process</h1>

<p>Another thing I’d like to comment on is Eno’s commitment respecting process in music. I’ve always felt that process is only as valuable as the quality of the resulting music, and in the case of No Pussyfooting and Discrete Music, I’m not very impressed with the outputs. To this day I still find strict Eno-ambient a bit of a dead end, though his work has fed into a booming “industry” of sound art installations lovingly process-crafted by a legion of academically trained, po-faced artists. As you can see from how I’ve cast these works, I don’t think much of them.</p>

<h1 id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding thoughts</h1>

<p>Eno’s a fascinating character. On the one hand he was a surpreme innovator, and I like a lot of his music. On the other hand, he’s also a bit of an art-school wanker, and an anti-Romantic, something at odds with my sympathy towards (a constrained) Romanticism, and respect for the Sublime. Still, can’t deny the man’s body of work.</p>
