    <p>This is an account of my personal love affair with Lego and model LL928.</p>

<h1 id="928">928</h1>

<p>It all started around about 1981 when I started getting lego sets. I was 5-6 years old and anything coming into contact with my senses felt extremely vivid. (Memories from that time remain similarly sharp - there might not be many of them, but they’re intense. From my subjective viewpoint, these memories are the most valuable things I have. I imagine all people experience something similar with childhood memories, although it’s not something we often talk about.)</p>

<p>While the first, modest Lego sets my brother and I received were cool, there were greater riches to be spied in the annual Lego catalogues we’d sometimes acquire. Seeing dioramas of many sets on display - whole cities on display - provided the feel of another world: an idealised (Danish) city peopled with friendly automatons. Lego “society” seemed so uncomplicated and idea; no one would ever swear or spit or be alcoholic or mentally ill. (All this was, of course, satirised very effectively in the first Lego Movie.)</p>

<p>What attracted me more than life on Lego Earth, however, was the possibility and promise of Lego space. The Lego Space sets looked amazing, and in toy shops I loved scanning the boxes showing rocket ships in front of Star Trek backgrounds. These scenes felt remote but again, cosmically benign.</p>

<p>Around 1982 my friend Kevin got one of the larger space sets, 924. This was part of a series of three spaceship models: 918, 924, and 928. These were all variations of the same blue and grey spaceship archetype (reminiscent but of course legally distinct from a Star Destroyer from Star Wars). 924 was pretty cool; it had a little cargo bay. But the set that really impressed me was the big daddy of the series, 928, sporting four grey rocket engines, compared to 924’s two and 918’s one. When my grandparents went on holiday to Australia in 1983, my mother arranged, at my behest for them to fetch back 928, duty free.</p>

<p>When they returned to Wellington some weeks later (in a short-bodied 747, landing at Wellington airport, can you imagine it?!), it turned out 928 was no longer being produced.Instead they picked up 6980, 928’s grand successor. (So expensive was the set that it was supposed to be my birthday <em>and</em> Christmas present combined. My parents seemed to have forgotten this come December, luckily.)</p>

<p>Now 6980 was a pretty decent set (lucky boy, so much privilege, etc), and it did have more going on than 928 (a detachable lab, a twin cockpit, and what looked like four cannons at the front). And yet, somehow for me it lacked the angular, solid seriousness of the earlier dreadnaught. So 928 remained lodged in a more wistful ventricle of my heart, and for many years afterwards (indeed, even into my late teens!) I would periodically to buy the most faithful of version of 928 I could from the lego pieces I had. I did a decent job, but I was never going to get there. 6980 turned out to be the last set of lego I had as a child. Thinking about it now, I’m not sure if my parents felt I already had enough, or if I lost interest in acquiring more. Probably a bit of both.</p>

<p>Not much happened for nearly 40 years, until my son Angus appeared on the scene and attained lego age. With each set he received I’d pine out loud for 928, and my highly practical wife Sally’s set about combing of trading sites for old space lego in the hope of spotting 928. Eventually a set of assorted space lego bricks came up, and we spied components from 928. To be honest I felt like it was a bit too late; to get the most out of 928, I really ought to be 8 years old. For Sally though, Angus could get that experience, and enjoy building with his Dad, so she bought the set. Our instincts were correct and from the pieces we were able to assemble a largely complete 928 set, shown below.</p>

</figure>

<p>So, what’s it like the assembling the lego set of your dreams 40 years later? Well, I have to say there wasn’t much in the way of euphoria or triumph. Angus and I built the set over a couple of hours, and then it was done. Was it everything I dreamed? Yes, but you feel a bit differently when you’re 46 than when you’re 6. The set is nice to have a look at, but it lacks the romantic misery of not getting what you want. It doesn’t feel like mine, more like I’ve borrowed it for the moment. That said, I do get some satisfaction sometimes by briefly walking around my living room with it making <em>psshew</em> noises.</p>

<h1 id="929">929</h1>

<p>But Sally didn’t stop there. Still keeping an eye on the second hand sites, Benny’s Spaceship from the Lego Movie, came up for sale, and she saw fit to buy it as a Christmas project for Gus and me. This ship sports “LL929” along the sides of its fuselage as a nod to 928, will henceforth be known as 929.</p>

<p>I found the character of Benny in the Lego Movie a little frustrating. I mean, it was nice he was there to represent classic Space Lego (although he should have worn the OG red or white spacesuit; the blue spacesuit came several years later.) And I didn’t like his spaceship. While referencing 928, it lacked the clean lines and was much too busy and festooned with crap. I would have preferred he was just flying 928 itself!</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/assets/lego/929.jpg" alt="Lego model '929'" title="Lego model '929'" />

</figure>

<p>Having built 929, I have to row back some of my criticisms. Although it certainly is festooned with crap, it’s well thought out crap, much of it nods to other classic space lego sets. And the set many moving parts, and is highly playable: there’s two sets of missile launchers, and even a couple of mini-fighters attached at the tip of each wing. The rococo ornamentation on the ship does have benefits. The second-hand set we bought had a few pieces missing, but with so much greebley carry on on the surface, it’s really hard to tell that some of it is not there.</p>

<h1 id="10497">10497</h1>

<p>For its 90th anniversary in 2022 Lego brought out 10497, a tribute to 928 (the 10497 number is a reference to the US catalogue number for the set, which is 497 - the number on the side of the ship remains “928” though). Sally asked me if I wanted it, and inevitably I said yes. And for Christmas 2022 Angus and I constructed it.</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>10497 is pitched as a modern version of 928, making extensive use of technic bricks for the skeleton of the ship. The standout feature is that the ship is now on two planes, with the fuselage set at a shallow angle to the wings. It looks super cool.</p>

<p>The set is about 150% of the size of the original, and features twice the number of bricks. Building it was like watching a story unfold, each element was had been chosen very thoughtfully. That said, by the end (after I estimate 10ish hours(!)) I was pretty over it. The result <em>looks</em> pretty swish - the retractable landing fear makes the orginal’s look a bit creaky. And 928’s austere cabin gets more decoration - the larger fuselage provides room for astronaut beds, the lack of which used to bother me about the old space lego ships as a kid (now, if they could just add a toilet…). There’s also an airlock door in between the cabin and the cargo area, which now pops out a ramp to get the litle car out of the ship. And the swinging rear doors are now fixed using locking pieces, a more natural solution than the 1 x 2 plate that had to be stuck on the top of the old model to keep it all in place.</p>

<p>That said, there are some downsides. The wing is now much thicker than the original - and the chunkier feel seems a bit unbalanced. Similarly the spoiler on top of the cabin now feels too large. The engines now have a more realistic look, but the old grey cones and cylinders of the original are to me the most iconic Space Lego pieces of all. But the biggest problem is that 10497 isn’t really a set to play with. Much of the exterior, esp the wing and the pieces supporting the cockpit, fall off when you touch it. The set is probably too heavy for little arms, too. Aside from the antennas, which were forever falling off, the rest of 928 was built like a brick shithouse. So not without its faults, but I’ll say that Lego did a pretty solid job with 10497.</p>

<p>Is 10497 redundant, indulgent, and pointless? Yes, but it remains a decent set, and I can’t say I regret having it.</p>

<h1 id="and-in-the-end">And in the end</h1>

<p>As with my other fixations documented here, there’s not much by way of conclusion. It’s worth giivng a shout out to <a href="http://thebrickblogger.com/2020/02/in-memory-of-lego-designer-jens-nygaard-knudsen/">Jens Nygaard Knudsen</a>, who invented not only 928 and the many of the Space Lego sets, but also the Lego minifigure. Praise him with great praise!</p>

<p>I’d like to give a “Lego isn’t what it was in the 80s” speech, but I don’t entirely believe it. It’s true that Lego from long ago feels purer than today’s swamp of sets licensed from media franchises (think Harry Potter or Star Wars), the creativity and imagination put in to Lego remains high. It’s exhausting to think of all those sets and all that plastic, but I can’t begrudge kids today having the same fun I have. So, keep going, I guess.</p>
