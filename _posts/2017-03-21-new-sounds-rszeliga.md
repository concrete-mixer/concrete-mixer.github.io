Our second sound donor (praise him with great praise!) is [Rob Szeliga](http://www.rszoniq.com), a UK-based sound designer, and he's sent through a nice range of recordings.

## Contributions

### Prayers at Osu Kannon Temple

This recording features a bit of tranquil bonging and chanting from a Buddhist temple in Japan. I've spent a bit of time in a few Japanese temples myself (a sign, I fear, of a misspent youth), so this recording brings back some memories of stone gardens, exquisite lawns, golden statues and, weirdly, eagles flying high over head.

Incidentally, the base CM sound library includes a [recording I did at the Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas in Sha Tin, Hong Kong](https://soundcloud.com/concrete-mixer/enter-the-chamber-of-the-10000-buddhas). That lacks the tranquility of this recording, because it was Chinese New Year and it was crowded with people casting [fortune sticks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kau_cim) to learn if they might get rich.

### Wind through stone wall

This excellent recording really transports you to a rather windy day in the English countryside. Makes you want to put on another layer or two of clothing. And emigrate. Brr!

### The horns of India

Firstly, the chaotic blarings of the bells are great - nice rich sound source, that - but Rob did a bit of granular synthesis to freeze the sounds in time and stretch them out into a sort of brief [illbient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illbient) composition. I've excised the signal processing from the recording for CM in case anyone thinks it's part of CM (if you think CM is capable of that kind of real-time DSP you'd be sadly mistaken).

That said, it's a nice piece of filtration and I feel a bit bad about the removal. Sorry Rob!

### Midday at the Foundling Museum

It's hard to imagine how midday could be signified with more gravitas than this clock manages.

### Underground Screech

There have been times when I've been on the London Underground where I've been a little concerned I'd never made it back to the outside world. It's certainly reassuring to hear a train in motion.

### Traction Engines

TRACTION ENGINES!

### Thanks Rob!
