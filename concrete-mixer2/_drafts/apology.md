# Philosophy

Even from a young age I found Christianity offputting. I guess the Bible offered nothing as exciting as Star Wars, esp when even the good stuff was framed in terms of morals. Ugh.

In high school I came to the view that hell is other Christians, esp the pentecostal types. I became slightly more conciliatory when I took on a female Christian friend, until I discovered New Atheism in the mid 2000s and decided there was no point pussyfooting around it: it was definitely all bollocks and I didn't want any part in it.

Amusingly, with the advent of Wokeism, the leftwing replacement of old time religion, I've gone back to feeling more well-disposed to Christianity. Even though Christians are annoying, they at least offer redemption, while Wokeism is a bit more Old Testament in its attitude to wrongthink.

(I pray that by the time I'm dead wokeism will feel as quaint as hippies do in the 2020s, but I'm not counting on it.)

Prior to my new atheism I had quite a bit of time for Buddhism. I was mainly entranced by the religion's embrace of infinite space and time. But the philosophy... well, the idea that suffering is born of desire, is more psychologically sophisticated than believing God decided you're irrevocably sinful, but good news: he loves you so it's ok, but if you don't embrace him you're doomed for eternity.
