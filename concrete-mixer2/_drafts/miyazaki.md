# Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind (1982)

This wasn't the first Ghibli film, but it was the film that made Ghibli happen. The story is set on an over-polluted world where the natural world has become so toxic humans cannot live in it, and can only survive in isolated enclaves. In one such enclave, the Valley of the Wind, Princess Nausicaa is confronted with an ancient weapon that must be stopped or else the Valley faces complete destruction.

Although Nausicaa was only Miyazaki's second film as director, he'd been in the industry nearly 20 years, and had prepped for Nausicaa by developing a manga. (He would continue to produce the manga, on and off, until its completion in 1994.) Even so, the film is - in my view - a neglected entry in Miyazaki's canon for two reasons. Firstly the film's unlavish budget resulted in some often rudimentary animation, well below the later standards set by Studio Ghibli. Secondly, the film ends with some cheap Deus ex-Machina which I imagine Miyazaki regreats. (The Nausicaa manga diverges heavily from the movie and avoids this.) On the other side of the balance sheet, the film is stacked full of themes, is a great piece of imaginative fantasy, and is impressively assured.

But then there's Princess Mononoke, Miyazaki's other fantasy.

Big claims require strong arguments. Well, let's start by looking at Nausicaa's opposition. Miyazaki has made quite a few films, but there are only a few that tackle similar themes:

- Laputa (ancient, dangerous technology)
- Princess Mononoke (ecology)
- Spirited Away (ecology, though peripherally)

Of those, in terms of high seriousness, Princess Mononoke is the most substantial. Now Princess Mononoke is a fine movie, but I've never liked it as much as Nausicaa. It has a more mature ending than Nausicaa, for in my mind Nausicaa has one weakness: a Deux ex-Machina ending. (The Nausicaa manga diverges )

Laputa is a Nausicaa lite. My Neighbour Totoro is a masterpiece of a children's film, but it is a kid's film. Porco Rosso is an admirably strange film. As for Princess Mononoke, it's kind of a Nausicaa Redux. Spirited Away is Totoro for tweens, another magnificent outing. The first two thirds of Howl's Moving Castle is amazing, while the final third is a bit meh. Ponyo on the Cliff is just slightly on the wrong side of silly. And I haven't seen the wind rises.
