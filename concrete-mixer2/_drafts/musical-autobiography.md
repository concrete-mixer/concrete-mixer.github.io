# Early stuff - 1994 - 2004

I first wanted to create sound in late 1993. I'd been turned on by Tangerine Dream, and the "renaissance" of ambient as chillout music. (In retrospect, the career I imagined having is approximate to that of Biosphere - not super famous, but important and longrunning.)

I needed gear. From studying Tangerine Dream and Jean Michel Jarre and Pink Floyd liner notes, the synth to get was a VCS3, and the only local electronica figure I was aware of who might have one was grandee Douglas Lilburn. I didn't feel comfortable about confronting him, but I knew Vitoria University had an electronic studio, and I had a vague hope said studio might flog me similar antiquated gear. (I got to hear Lilburn's synths in action at a Wellington concert about ten years later. Victoria University continues to hold on to Lilburn's equipment, because it's valuable and it still usable).

What I ended up doing was buying a couple of very cheap and not very capable synthesizers. I had no money for a decent recorder, so had no multitrack capability, and so couldn't do much of anything. Instead I teamed up with Michael and Andy in a band called Monkeyshuttle. Andy played guitar, Michael had a sampler and a computer and knew what he was doing. I mostly provided arrogance: unlike the others I'd done two years of piano and three of violin, and in my head that made me "properly musical". In truth I wasn't really anything.

Monkeyshuttle was a lot of fun; it lasted about a year and yielded one document in the form of an inscrutable half hour gig on Active.

With money from my 21st birthday in 1996, I bought a four track cassette recorder and spent a couple of years making demos. I enjoyed this time a lot, and while the results were amateurish I did have a voice of my own for the first time. I also had a name for my "act": Steve Satori. It's a name I still kind of like, but being a comical name, it implied to me a kind of comical music, which ultimately lead me into a dead end: in Wellington in the late 90s, electronica was a very serious thing indeed.

In 1997 I joined the workforce and bought my first sampler, an Akai S2000. I got to work producing sequenced tracks for the first time. I worked hard; this was the time to finally achieve my ambitions. Feeling that "Steve Satori" was a big juvenile, and being gripped by a P-Funk kick, I changed my act name to Aquaboogie.

The problem was I'd already antagonised the local scene by declaring it was shit in a longrunning email spat. Having burned that bridge, I focused on amusing my friends. The silliness was fun, but it was a dead end. The biggest calamity was I didn't have an ear for production. Playing around with feedback and tape hiss this defect wasn't so immediately apparent, but working with a sampler in an era of digital precision and careful construction, my shortcomings were more obvious: I was composing leaden tracks with lousy samples from a default Akai sample (floppy!) disk. and thinking "that's good enough".

I persisted, without really getting better, into the early 2000s. Friends who were non-electronica fans found my tracks amusing, but I wanted to be a Serious Artist. Frustrations continued.

Things changed a bit in 2002 when I moved to using Audiomulch as a DAW. As has been the case since the beginning, really, I'd taken technological cues from Michael, who _had_ gotten a career off to the ground. Our differences were instructive. He listened to a wider variety of music, took more of an interest in how others made sounds; he gigged regularly; he got on well with others, and most certainly didn't start fights. And above all, he had more talent.

That said, my tracks did keep improving, and I started gigging with Pete May's While You Were Sleeping ambient nights in 2003-2004.

# Maturity 2005 - 2012

In 2005 I had a bout of colitis that ruined me for half a year. After being prescribed cortico-steroids, however, the energy rush had me smashing out tracks, and in 2006 I started a "net label" with my mate Andy. I put together an album was International Travel, built largely out of samples from world music CDs.

It's a weird album; at times it sounds like early 90s world music ambient (ie not great), but at other times it's idiosyncratically weird - in a good way. I got so deep into the rabbit hole creatively that it led to strange choices. I wouldn't say I'm entirely proud of it, but by God for once in my life I really tried.

We launched our albums to very little interest.

I guess this was the point where my dream died. I mean, it's not like I wasn't already aware I was getting nowhere; the ambient scene I'd wanted to be part of died off almost as soon as I'd jumped on the bandwagon. Even Michael, who was was the real deal, could only get CDs released in batches of 500, and was never able to ditch the day job. So what was left at this point? Well, I could still have fun being creative.

Michael and I started the Malty Media project in 2006 to play a gig in Japan. The gig was inconclusive, but we ended up hosting a monthly radio show for a couple of years and we released three EPs. I do regret that we never put out an album, but we never quite had an album's worth of material on the go at any given time.

In 2008 Michael, Andy and I organised a proper CD compilation of various acts we knew. We self-consciously called it Apropos of Nothing. Once it was done we did a couple of gigs to promote it, but beyong that our hearts weren't really in it, and our distribution efforts were non-existent. I remember the relief I felt a few years later chucking the few dozen copies of the CD I had into a skip.

In 2009 I released a compilation of ambienty things I'd done, and then in 2012 I released a compilation of the more tuneful tracks I'd done over the previous 10 years. In a way I felt like I was winding up operations.

Also in 2012, becoming more reconnected with the space world with the advent of SpaceX, and aware of the 2012 Mayan prophecies, I made Space 2012, a sort of ambient collage album. A bit like International Travel, it was highly idiosyncratic, but had its good bits - even the track called Elon Musk, which looked upon his space aspirations favourably. (That aged well.) I thought space fans might be interested in the album, but again my efforts at promotion elicited no attention.

Towards the end of 2012 Malty Media put out our last track, based on Bear Grylls giving himself and enema. It was a good way to end that project.

# The dark age 2013-2019

At the start of 2013 I was fed up with music and tired of sequencing tracks in DAWs and agonising over the right synth sounds to use. I was also out of ideas. I still felt that making music was my creative "life's work", but I was now bereft of inspiration and even desire to create.

Over the next few years I tried a different tack, writing audio software using an audio programming language called ChucK. The goal was to build an automatic ambient machine generated endlessly interesting sound. I found that field recordings provided the most stochastic basis, so made a machine that randomly loaded field recordings and filtered them through effects. This goal was reasonably modest and I achieved it reasonably easily, coming up with a tool called Concrete Mixer that could run inexpensively on a Raspberry Pi. I imagined it would be great for small galleries or art installations, but the final iteration of the software provided internet streaming. I once tried to get one version, called Flush Tones (based on an idea I'd had in the late 90s), into the City Gallery's toilets, but received a humourless and slightly pompous rejection from the gallery's curator.

In 2015 I became a father and for the next few years I had little energy or opportunity for music.

# Rebirth 2020 - 2025

In 2019, Michael moved to Bitwig as his DAW, and as Bitwig had Linux support, for the third time I appropriated his sound setup. Again, copying him, I bought a Zoom H1n recorder (what can I say, the man has very grabbable coat tails...), and took it on a trip to Japan. I found working with these recordings in Bitwig to be immensely straightforward, and within a few months I compiled a new album.

I called the album Assemblage, as the theme was assembling music out of a pile of field recordings (the ones from Japan plus a several I'd made since, especially during the first Covid lockdown). I applied a simple rule: all sound had to be derived from my own field recordings - no synths allowed (even if, at times, fragments of field-recorded sound were treated to sound synthy).

Thematically I leaned heavily on the first track I compiled, based on a recording I made at the Takayama Spring Festival in Japan. The Japan visit occurred a fortnight after my father had died, and I found I was able to steer the recordings towards an intensity that conveyed (to me at least) my grief. When it came time to find a cover for the album I used a photo I'd taken of Karori Cemetary, which (to perhaps spell it out to baldly) suggesting that the "assemblage" in question one of graves. If that all seems a touch morbid, this was also 2020, the year of Covid, and I had upped the ante by reading Camus' The Plague, so that I was well and truly wallowing in existential (and perhaps teenagerly) angst.

The album wasn't all misery, though; arguably the best and most musical track was based on sounds recorded at the Nagoya Science Museum, and featured Sally and Angus talking through a pitch shifter (actually present in the museum, not an effect I added on later).

With Bitwig and the H1n I felt I finally had a working method that I felt comfortable with. For the next few years I worked exclusively with my own field recordings, making the most of that limitation by using a modern DAW to take often spare recordings and turn them into viable (hopefully) sound collages. The additional benefit of working this way is that rather than doing "music" to achieve some sort of greatness, what I was doing became more of an autobiographical hobby, like compiling photo albums of holiday snaps.

From 2020 to 2024 I produced four releases in this manner. By late 2023, though, I found that, temporarily at least, there wasn't more I could do field recording-wise without starting to repeat myself. Looking at what to do next, I wondered about returning to the hardware world, and I discovered that while an original EMS VCS3 was still out of my reach, Erica synths was producing an excellent and modernised clone of the VCS3 design, and I shelled out for one. (This marked the first time I'd bought a properly top shelf piece of kit.) I wasn't quite sure how to approach the synth at first: I loved tinkering with it, but I struggled to come up with something coherently musical with it. The solution proved elegant: the instrument was essentially a vehicle for weird oscillations and modulations, why not record myself manipulating it live, treat it as a field recording, and apply my existing workflow to that recording. With vastly richer recordings than I'd got out in the field, I found it much easier to compile tracks. This new chapter is not yet complete, though, so for now I'll end it there.

# What's it all been about?

I really don't know. In terms of quality, I'm proudest of Malty Media and the Longbrows series. That should be "enough", but if I was giving advice to others I'd rattle off a pile of suggestions based on things I did wrong. I've already hinted at a few of my shortcomings, so I won't reiterate them here, but I will say that they all stem from a passive temperament. At no stage did I ever fully commit myself to the cause. The best time to have done that was my early 20s, but I prioritised having an income and being (broadly) sensible, in the expectation that I'd get there "eventually". Well I did, I suppose, but not in a way that will trouble historians of music.

Regardless of the impacts, what of my talent. It's unfortumate I've grown up with Michael Upton and am painfully aware of how much more nuanced his approach to music is than mine. That said, in recent years I've carved out my own niche and I think I've executed with some subtlety. The problem is that in making music that I like and that I think is compelling, it's hard to know whether I'm just fooling myself, especialy when I never receive any real criticism, positive or negative. Well, it's helped pass the time, I suppose.
