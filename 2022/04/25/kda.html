    <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>While viewing JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure MMD videos I stumbled across some JoJo dancings choreographed to songs by a group called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K/DA">K/DA</a>. The music was sufficiently impressive that I decided to watch the original videos, discovering that K/DA is an animated “girl” group comprised of characters from a video game called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends">League of Legends</a>. I then watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de-xgNEsE3I">a useful explainer about the group</a> and learned that K/DA’s western producers intentionally wrote the songs to emulate the K-pop genre. This essay is a personal (ie idiosyncratic and unreliable) exploration of K/DA and my experience of K-pop.</p>

<h1 id="k-pop-and-its-part-in-my-downfall">K-pop and its part in my downfall</h1>

<p>Because K/DA is K-pop-oriented, it makes sense to examine K-pop first. Well, Wikipedia can give you a more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-pop">sensible explanation of K-pop</a> than I ever could, so instead I’ll yammer on about how I got into it.</p>

<p>Going waaay back in time to the late 2000s, my wife and I began watching K dramas. (We’d watched lots of HK dramas, and a J and T drama or two, so it’s not as random as it might seem.) K-dramas proved to be a gateway drug to K variety shows, specifically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_Man_(South_Korean_TV_series)">Running Man</a>, which was very popular across asia in the early 2010s. Running Man frequently featured K-pop singers, and we did take some interest K-pop singers who were in the set of people who had been in dramas <em>and</em> appeared on Running Man, but it wasn’t until that epoch-defining revelation of PSY’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangnam_Style">Gangnam Style</a> in 2012 that I began taking an active interest in K-Pop.</p>

<p>(Now I’ll concede that Gangnam Style didn’t have a lot going on musically, but the bizarre video (bizarre then, at least, not so much now) captured the charm of the Korean sense of humour, and I more than played my part in helping the song get be the first video to break the 1 billion YouTube view threshold by the end of 2012.)</p>

<p>So I started to explore K-pop proper. I have to say I was more interested in the girl groups, because the boy groups seemed stuck permanently in 1988 making <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_jack_swing">New Jack Swing</a> singles. There were exceptions: I had a fondness for Big Bang, for example, but they were very much against the run of play.</p>

<p>In 2012 the biggest girl group was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girls%27_Generation">SNSD</a>, but I preferred the more eccentric groups like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Caramel">Orange Caramel</a>, and (later) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crayon_Pop">Crayon Pop</a>; or the more EDMey outfits like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F(x)_(musical_group)">f(x)</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2NE1">2NE1</a>.</p>

<p>So I kept an eye on things for a few years, but around 2016 I began to lose interest in all K phenomena. With K dramas I’d seen as many variations on “downtrodden but plucky female implausibly pursued by multiple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaebol">chaebol</a> heir suitors” as I cared to. With K variety, after a few hundred episodes of Running man the formula got pretty stale for me - as I think it would for most people after that long. As for K-pop, the music was also beginning to feel a bit samey, or at least the good stuff was largely drowned out by the dire. I was also put off by the petty (and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Sun_scandal">not so petty</a> scandals continually bubbling up (I used to think Korean “netizens” were the most judgemental people on Earth, until Facebook and Twitter deranged the brains of Westerners). Most demoralising of all was the steady rate of K-pop suicides. I ended up feeling that to take an interest in the phenomenon was to be complicit in the harm it caused, so I stopped following it.</p>

<p>Until last year. My K pop curiosity was piqued again when I learned that boy group <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTS">BTS</a> had topped the Billboard charts in the US. I thought a girl group might have a chance of doing this, but never a boy group, even one with <a href="https://www.usbtsarmy.com/">their own army</a>. Curiouser still, the number one hit song in question, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdZLi9oWNZg">Dynamite</a>, eptomises everything I find boring about boy groups. But <em>snooty sniff</em> I guess there’s now an audience for that in America. That said, the BTS chaps seem nice - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJZeMgqQMjA">at least when they interact with robots</a> - and I wish them well.</p>

<p>Since I’d taken the trouble to investigate BTS, I thought I might as well learn more about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpink">Blackpink</a>, the pre-eminent K-pop girl group who had debuted and risen to the top while I was off the K-pop bandwagon.</p>

<p>Blackpink are successors to YG Entertainment’s 2NE1, who unceremoniously expired when one of their members experienced a rather minor drug scandal. Blackpink is another four-piece that largely continues 2NE1 (give or take; they’re younger, prettier, and less weird, but the music is about the same). The group is comprised of mostly-singers Ji Soo and Rose, and mostly-rappers Jennie and Lisa.</p>

<p>Over the past six years Blackpink have assembled numerous shock-and-awe singles. My favourites are Ddu-du Ddu-du (see below), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioNng23DkIM">How You Like that</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dISNgvVpWlo">Whistle</a>.</p>

<p>The songs often vary wildly between angsty singing by Ji Soo and Rose, and petulant rapping from Jennie and Lisa. I confess I tend to spend the singish bits waiting for the next rap segment, but the songs are well-constructed, and there are numerous excursions into unexpected territory that have me going “whaaat!?” - in a good way. Basically they’re a riot.</p>

<p>And that’s before we come to the videos. YG has produced some glitzy stuff in the past (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbokV76tkU">take that!</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7_lSP8Vc3o">and that!</a>), but those vids seem minimalist in comparison to the almost baroque production value of recent Blackpink outings. Ddu-du Ddu-du has some particularly eye-poppingly odd moments.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IHNzOHi8sJs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>During my investigations I discovered that Blackpink had a <a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81106901?trackId=255824129">Netflix doco</a> - unthinkable for a US-based media company to be producing a few years ago, all too predictable now. “Blackpink: Light up the Sky” is a reasonably frank portrayal of life under the K-pop regime. (To give you a very brief idea of how the system works, aspiring adolescent K-Poppers are scouted - usually in shopping malls - by a management agency, and then auditioned. Those who make the grade live in an agency dormitory for several years, being trained around the clock. Wages are slim, and chances of unceremonious disposal are high. Gradually the promising coalesce into prospective groups, until finally the tight-knit, loyal, battle-hardened and success-hungry Chosen are anointed. Whatever else you might think about it - and I think quite a lot about it, actually - it’s a practice that gets results.</p>

<p>I was suspicious that the doco was purely propaganda, and I imagine there was a lot that was glossed over, but I got the impression the group were able to recount their struggles with genuine candour. We may not have gotten the whole story, but if you aspired to K-pop glory you wouldn’t watch “Light up the Sky” and conclude that it’s all sweetness and light.</p>

<p>Here’s an aside: watching the doco, it occurred to me that Blackpink’s training must have occurred during 2NE1’s final years. Were 2NE1 aware that some YG’s trainees would eventually succeed them? How could they not have known, for if not these trainees, then others would eventually replace them. The faces inevitably change, but the show goes on. Tough business…</p>

<p>If being a K-pop trainee seems nightmarish, it’s nothing compared to the horror of being in a successful group: 18 hour days, endless appearances at fan meets, lengthy video shoots, and trying to seem interesting-but-also-down-to-earth on highly-scripted variety show appearences.</p>

<p>But wait, there’s more! Long international tours, the constant fear of physical attacks by obsessive fans or sexual attacks from sleazy senior entertainment figures, and the stress of attaining and retaining lucrative product endorsements. On a more personal level your every action needs to justify the loyalty of fans, your family, your bandmates, your country, and those you work with in your agency. Then there’s the fear of being ground down by excessive online opprobrium. Having a personal life is extremely difficult; a love life is forbidden lest it upset your obsessive fans.</p>

<p>With all that going on you can see why mental health crises, drug scandals, and suicides are quite common in the K-pop world.</p>

<p>So far Blackpink seem to have survived, but there will inevitably be a point when they will drift from being “it” to becoming “was”. In the doco the group’s members seemed to think that all the sacrifices have been worth it; I hope that’s true and continues to so. And at this point it’s going to be a hell of a group that surpasses them.</p>

<h2 id="hang-on">Hang on</h2>

<p>So I’ve spent a lot of time cataloguing some of the participants and many of the crimes of K-pop, but I should point out that manufactured pop groups, and indeed every popular musical combo at any time and place, has been subject to some level of exploitation. The difference, I would argue, is that western kids are less likely to put up with K-pop-style regimentation, and so aren’t subjected to those excesses, whereas the communal conformity of Korean culture tends to increase the likelihood of everybody going along with things until harm happens.</p>

<p>Actually, I’d <em>like</em> to thing that Western kids would be less susceptible, but I’m not sure they would. Hmmm.</p>

<h1 id="kda">K/DA</h1>

<p>Now we’ve got a sense of the high-stakes tension of a real K-pop group, let us decompress somewhat and consider a virtual one. I vaguely heard of K/DA when they debuted in 2018, but this was during my “over it” K-pop dark ages, so I didn’t bother to investigate. But in late 2021, thanks to a tenuous JJBA connection, I was now in a place to give it a whirl.</p>

<p>I find the idea of a Western music production company doing a take on K-pop very interesting (even if it’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_Games">Riot Games</a>, of all things). I’ve never been entirely sure if K-pop was actually a real style, rather than Korean emulation of whatever Western pop excretes at the time (I have to confess I haven’t paid attention to Western chart music for about 20 years). So K/DA’s existence is a confirmation of sorts that there’s enough in K-pop for it to be its own thing.</p>

<p>(On that note, I often detect in K-pop elements of what I would consider Latin and Indian popular music. I wonder whether this is coincidental, or a deliberate attempt to court the global music market. If it is deliberate, it’s a great strategy; if it’s coincidental then K-pop has an admirably wide-ranging musical pallette.)</p>

<p>OK, on to K/DA itself. No, actually, time for a joke. Before going further I should point out that my prior reference points for videos made by animated entities are the following:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h9nE2spOw_o" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/159063171?h=e17ebd1d93&amp;byline=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>These examples aren’t germane to anything that follows, I just thought it amusing to consider the Archies in the same sentence as K/DA. And as for Do the Bart Man, well… there’s at least a New Jack Swing connection to K-Pop there.</p>

<p>So K/DA is a virtual girl group featuring four League of Legends characters. I’ve never played League of Legends and have no idea who the group “members” are, or what they’re about, and I think I can get by without having to learn more. So using my personal reference points I’ll characterise the group as including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the gritty, urban one</li>
  <li>the cocktail bar singer</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanie_C">Sporty Spice</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumiho">Foxy Lady</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The first single is called Pop/Stars. Here’s the video:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UOxkGD8qRB4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>I find the vid to be a bravura display of motion, colour, and secondary sex characteristics. (I feel obliged to condemn the vid’s appeal to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_gaze">male gaze</a>. Tut tut! But in my estimation the Pop/Stars video is a relatively weak entry in the annals of misogyny.</p>

<p>The music was produced by League of Legends’ in-house music producers, who drafted Korean and American singers to provide vocal services. The song’s style broadly conforms to the EDM end of K-pop, plausibly like something from YG producer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_Park">Teddy Park</a> who produces Blackpink’s works. It’s hard to quantify but there’s a more westernised sensibility to the Pop/Stars than “standard” K-pop. It’s more gut feel than anything, but I feel the song ticks more boxes for me as a western listener than a K-pop song would, and I’m guessing the opposite would be true for a Korean listener.</p>

<p>While musically the song’s well-constructed, and the production is immaculate, there’s not much going on lyrically - unless you’re a connoisseur of bog-standard hiphop “I’m much better than you” braggery. (I suppose the braggery is appropriate when you consider these characters are contesting a game, but it’s pretty insubstantial nonetheless.) But since pop music isn’t Milton, I’ll give it a pass. All up then, I reckon Pop/stars is manufactured pop <em>par excellence</em>, and the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4gOc8TsQed9eqnqJct2c5v">hundreds of millions of Spotify plays</a> and YouTube views suggests it has been very successful.</p>

<p>One final thing to mention: Pop/stars was performed in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9oDlvOV3qs">bizarre ritual</a> at the opening ceremony of the 2018 League of Legends world champs (presented by Mastercard!), held in (where else?) South Korea. The real singers of the song were present (nice for them!), accompanied virtually by their K/DA avatars. If I’ve got this correct, the virtual members could only be viewed by spectators via some sort of augmented reality app on their smartphones. I have complex feelings about whether this is pioneering or silly, but I will say that if I’d tried to explain the scenario to my late grandfather, he’d have given me a look like I was a fucking idiot.</p>

<h2 id="more">“More”</h2>

<p>In 2020 K/DA released a second single, “More”, which is indeed more of the same:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3VTkBuxU4yk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>To my mind the music has an edge over Pop/Stars, but the video is greatly inferior. Characters have a less “cartoony”, more 3 dimensional look, but this sends the tumbling into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley">uncanny valley</a>, and the result is vaguely repellant. Lyrically the song is a facsimile of Pop/Stars, so… meh? So it’s a bit of a mixed result.</p>

<p>In my JoJo survey I jokingly suggested some MMD videos of JJBA characters dancing to More were superior to the original. That’s a bit unfair, but I will say this video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l1MBNgXLr4">JoJo villains replicating More’s antics</a> is pleasingly silly.</p>

<p>2020 also saw K/DA release <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4gOc8TsQed9eqnqJct2c5v/discography/all?uri=spotify:album:26IdRjba8f8DNa7c0FwfQb">All Out</a> an EP which featured More plus four other songs. You’d expect the non-single songs to be filler, but they’re actually pretty decent. And all up I find myself hoping that K/DA will release, well, more material in future.</p>

<h1 id="stumbling-to-some-sort-of-conclusion">Stumbling to some sort of conclusion</h1>

<p>Compared with the K-pop mill, K/DA feels comparatively less exploitative, in that the human vocalists are basically session performers, so outside the terms of the their session time they’re free to live their lives as they want. But this replaces the indentured misery of the K-pop system with the (literal) “gig economy”, and it’s debatable  how much of an improvement it is. Do you want to be completely possessed by your corporate masters, or used and disgarded as they see fit? What an industry! Who’d want to be part of it?</p>

<p>All I can say from my comfortable vantage point is that I have been both entertained and disturbed by K-pop. Yay!</p>
