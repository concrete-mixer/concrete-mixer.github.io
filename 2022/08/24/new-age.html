    <p>I want to write a survey of New Age music that I like, but I’m hamstrung by not having a decent definition of what New Age music is other than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it">I know it when I hear it</a>. It’s easy to identity common elements of New Age music: trappings of Eastern mysticism, “world music” instrumentation, cosmic yearning, FM synthesisers, California; but there’s music that contains some of these elements that I struggle to think of as New Age, and music with none of these elements that I couldn’t classify as anything else.</p>

<p>I should declare my prejudice: I’m skeptical of the New Age generally. Partly this is skepticism of New Age thinking, although I confess I’m not wholly unsympathetic. Partly I find much New Age music cheesy and embarrassing. (I had a bad formative experience with Constance Demby’s Novus Magnificat as a teenager, for example.) But over the past 20 years, I’ve discovered quite a few genuinely New Age albums that are genuinely good. Some are good in spite of their New Age trappings, and some are even good because of them. It’s a strange situation, and I thought it might be interesting to explore some of this music that induces in me such conflicting feelings.</p>

<h1 id="the-harmonic-choir---hearing-solar-winds-1982">The Harmonic Choir - Hearing Solar Winds (1982)</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/new-age/hearing-solar-winds.jpg" width="300" alt="Hearing Solar Winds album cover" title="Hearing Solar Winds" /></p>

<p>I first heard throat singing on KLF’s Chill Out, back in the mid 90s. My KLF-listening friends and I assumed the effect was a resonant filter put on the singer’s voice, and we only found out later that humans could actually make those sounds was pretty astonishing.</p>

<p>Overtonal singing originates from the steppe of Asia, but in the mid 1970s an American named David Hykes assembled his Harmonic Choir, to project over- and undertones to curious Western audiences.</p>

<p>Hearing Solar Winds was recorded in a French Church over several nights in 1983. It’s just voices and reverb and the occasional tinging Buddhist chime (which I find a bit unnecessary, but I don’t begrudge it).</p>

<p>Proceedings commence with Rainbow Voice, in which a solo voice emerges from the vacuum, producing, well, a spectrum of harmonics. It reminds me of the numerous hours I spent as a late teen low-pass filter sweeping a bass drone, and enjoying the hearing harmonics wink in and out of existence. This super bare arrangement - voice, harmonics, reverberation is a great platform on which to kick off the album.</p>

<p>“Multiplying Voices At the Heart of the Body of Sound” (not an early Tangerine Dream track title, but is indistinguishable from one), as the title suggests, introduces multiple voices, singing the same tone but slightly detuned to create beats. The vocal control on display is awesome, while the detuning effect gives relieves the New Agery with a bit of grit. Eventually the voices resolve into major key chords, but it doesn’t feel sappy, it feels kind of right.</p>

<p>Arc Descents - again as the title suggests, features voices slowly descending, falling out of and into tune gracefully. Spacey. The strangely modernly-titled Gravity Waves is a 2001ish soundscape of gradually evolving harmonies. The longest track is Telescoping, where the voices ranging through one another in a slowly changing, hypnotic way.</p>

<p>On Ascending and Descending the voices range up and down in a way similar to the opener Rainbow Voice. It’s slightly reminiscent of the Popul Vuh track that opens Herzog’s Nosferatu. Then the sound fades away.</p>

<p>What makes this album so good? I think part of the key is that it’s powered solely by the human voice, which makes it timeless. The voices are suspended in space too, and the church’s reverb kind leaves them floating in eternity. The motivations of the choir are New Age and the sound is warm and positive, yet none of these elements are in any way a detriment.</p>

<p>Hearing Solar Winds is a great showcase for Hykes’ vision and the Harmonic Choir’s skill. Also, the album has helped me to slumber on many a night, so thanks, team!</p>

<h1 id="steve-hillage---rainbow-dome-musick-1979">Steve Hillage - Rainbow Dome Musick (1979)</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/new-age/rainbow-dome-musick.jpg" width="300" alt="Rainbow Dome Musick album cover" title="Rainbow Dome Musick" /></p>

<p>Steve Hillage and wife/partner Miquette Giraudy were previously in the prog-hippie band Gong, where the pair provided some of the group’s more contemplative electronic moments (ie tracks where no one banged on about bloody pothead pixies).</p>

<p>Rainbow Dome Musick was “Recorded for the Rainbow Dome at the Festival for Mind-Body-Spirit Olympia London April 21-29. 1979.”, which confirm’s the album’s New Age pedigree. Proceedings commence with the sound of water trickling into a pool, which, on playing back just now encouraged my wife to use the bathroom. Over this sound electric piano and synth flutter about in gently and lovingly. Gradually a spiraling sequencer comes in to play. To this celestial wafting, is added Hillage’s guitar.</p>

<p>Four Ever Rainbow starts with a ting bell sound and some raspy bass monosynth harmonic twiddling. There’s then a parade of catlike sinewaves and a plinky heavy delayed synth. It’s very New Age, but more shockingly, it sounds an awful lot like the Orb. This is no coincidence: Rainbow Dome Musick was a disc spun by the Orb’s LX Paterson and the KLF’s Jimmy Cauty when they (re)discovered ambient in the late 80s. Indeed, Hillage and Giraudy collaborated with the Orb on the wonderful Orb track Blue Room.</p>

<h1 id="iasos---inter-dimensional-music-1975">Iasos - Inter-dimensional music (1975)</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/new-age/interdimensional-music.jpg" width="300" alt="Inter-dimensional Music album cover" title="Inter-dimensional Music" /></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iasos_(musician)">Iasos</a> is an American-Greek New Ager, and this album from the mid 1970s feels much later than that, because it contains many New Age/ambient tropes. The music is clear and peaceful without being cloying, and there’s a fresh, bright openness to it. The arrangement is reasonably jazzy, with flute, guitar, and piano, garnished with synth washes and plenty of space in the arrangements. It’s a musical document that’s both utterly infused by the New Age, without feeling dogmatically bound to it. To me the standout track is Rainbow Canyon, which has a Gongish, Krautrocky vibe. Lots of shimmering slide or pedal-steel guitar.</p>

<h1 id="ashra---blackouts-1977">Ashra - Blackouts (1977)</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/new-age/blackouts.jpg" width="300" alt="Blackouts album cover" title="Blackouts" /></p>

<p>Ashra started life as the Krautrock band Ash Ra Tempel, who produced some remarkable albums in the early 1970s (including a collaboration with Timothy Leary?!). By 1977 the group’s creative powerhouses Klaus Schulze and Manuel Gottsching had gone their own ways; Schulze had embarked on a successful solo career as a synth guru (curiously, despite his music being essentially My Thing, I’ve never been moved by it), while Gottsching rebranded as Ashra, a banner for his solo work. The title of the first Ashra album, New Age of Earth (1976), gives a clear indication of Gottsching’s intentions, but the followup album Blackouts is the one I wish to include in my “good” New Age list.</p>

<p>The first track, “77 Slightly Delayed”, is a genial piece, synth-propelled and with interest maintained by Garcia-esque guitar. (This track is in the “style” known as Berlin School, which basically boils down to a synth sequence plus a human-played solo. Initially pioneered by Tangerine Dream with their first sequencer-driven track Phaedra, the Berlin-residing artists Edgar Froese, Klaus Schulze, and Manuel Gottsching elaborated on the style through the 70s - Froese mostly on his solo albums, while Schulze and Gottsching made it their primary modus operandi.) Schulze’s Berlin School sound is (to my mind) anaemic and dull, but Gottsching gave it a bit more variation and texture, esp on his most prominent album, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E2-E4">E2-E4</a> from 1981.)</p>

<p>Track 2, Midnight on Mars, is a gentle space jazz outing. Don’t Trust The Kids, sounds more like Air than anything else!? The track is attached to its followup, Blackouts, which erupts in a blaze of guitar solo. Shuttlecock is a geometric spiral of multiple guitars and afro rhythms. Concluding the album is the more straightforwardly New Agey Lotus Part I - IV, which shuffles around reasonably cheerfully, although some dissonance is allowed in at one point.</p>

<p>New Age of Earth is more straightforwardly New Age than Blackouts, but because of that it’s less interesting. Is Blackouts New Age enough? Well, if you compare it to the primordial fire of Ash Ra Tempel’s first album, it is, yes. If you compare it to something <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts_of_Space_Records">Hearts of Spacey</a>, not so much. Interestingly, the Ashra album following Blackouts, Correlations (1979), was a more rock(!) affair, so it’s almost like over the course of three albums Gottsching recanted his New Age swerve.</p>

<p>Blackouts then, represents an imperfect example of the Krautrock trend of evolving from experimental rock to a much softer, more appealing and largely New Age sound. Tangerine Dream, Michael Rother, Popul Vuh (earlier than most), and Cluster (on increasingly New Age label Sky Records!) all went there. Those that didn’t faded into obscurity, or were Kraftwerk. It was a strangely weak end to arguably the most fertile art music movement in the late 20th Century. On the other hand, if it paid for mortgages, you know, fair enough.</p>

<h1 id="tony-scott---music-for-zen-meditation-and-other-joys-1964">Tony Scott - Music for Zen Meditation and Other Joys (1964)</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/new-age/music-for-zen-meditation.jpg" width="300" alt="Music for Zen Meditation album cover" title="Music for Zen Meditation" /></p>

<p>Tony Scott was primarily a jazz clarinetist, but was interested in music from other cultures, and produced an album sufficiently early to be considered the first of the New Age. (You could make a case for it being a seminal ambient or world music album too. Hell, let’s add jazz fusion to the list just for fun.)</p>

<p>The arrangement is very minimal: Scott &amp; clarinet, plus koto and shakuhachi. At first the music sounds like standard minor key Japanese folk music, but Scott’s clarinet puts in enough bend to the notes that you realise you’re listening to something deliberately other. Scott isn’t merely - and I’m putting this perhaps too crudely - “going native”, he’s contributing his own ideas to Japanese music.</p>

<p>There’s another joy to the album: being the first album of World or New Age music, it’s completely unselfconscious. Clearly, purely New Age, without any of the bullshit that the genre later accreted.</p>

<p>My only criticism of Music for Zen Meditation - and a more general criticism of this mode of Japanese folk music - is that the minimal arrangement, the meditative mood, and the traditional scale used make for a very limited style. I know that that’s kind of the point: the intent is to transport the listener’s mind to the same Zen place, every Zen time; but I think it’s still worth pointing out. You could listen to one song or 100 albums, you’re only going to get only one effect.</p>

<h1 id="michael-stearns---planetary-unfolding-1981">Michael Stearns - Planetary Unfolding (1981)</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/new-age/planetary-unfolding.jpg" width="300" alt="Planetary Unfolding album cover" title="Planetary Unfolding" /></p>

<p>Michael Stearns’ biggest claim to fame is that he scored the early 90s “non-narrative” (apparently) documentary film Baraka. His career began a long way before that, however, and Planetary Unfolding is a remarkable document from the early 80s. The first track, “In the Beginning”, unfurls inexorably from a quiet bass drone into a transcendent crescendo that I would have to say is the transcendiest and cresciendiest that I’ve ever heard.</p>

<p>The rest of the album proceeds with much the same majesty. The only duff track is Life in the Gravity Well, but even then because it contains a wailing chanteuse part that isn’t to my taste. (Now I’m not against wailing in itself: there’s a similar example in the KLF’s Chill Out, and I am completely in awe of Ofra Haza. No, it’s the particular <em>style</em> of this wailing: it’s a New Age, swims-with-dolphins and gives-birth-underwater kind of a wail. That’s how I think about it, anyway.)</p>

<p>The final track, Something’s Moving, starts with a tickyticky sound that is quite odd for a concluding track, but it music eventually resolves with a wonderful sense of completion.</p>

<p>On the face of it there’s not much about Plantary Unfolding is definitively New Age; it could be considered space rock, or ambient. For me the New Ageyness is in the unashamed embrace of grandeur and transcendence. It’s not something Eno would find tasteful; Tangerine Dream would embrace it but also make it cold and alien. Another element crucial to the album’s success is the use of early 80s analog-synthesis-in-its-prime synths, rather than mid 80s digital synths, which would have given the album a more brittle sound (see Novus Magnificat).</p>

<p>A further revelation is that the album as a whole reminds me of my favourite ambient album, the KLF’s Chill Out. This could be put down to the superficial similarity of the synthetic arrangements, but I suspect that somewhere deep down there is a kindred spirit between Rockman, King Boy, and New Age practitioners like Stearns. (Come to think of it, I’ve just remembered the KLF’s obsession with Ley Lines. And Jimmy Cauty did those posters for Lord of the Rings. But worryingly, if there’s a bit of New Age even in pop’s most piss-taking pranksters, then really no one’s safe.)</p>

<h1 id="enya---watermark-1988">Enya - Watermark (1988)</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/new-age/watermark.jpg" width="300" alt="Watermark album cover" title="Watermark" /></p>

<p>Despite my disgust at Constance Demby (poor old Constance, RIP), 15 year old me did very much enjoy the fiddle-dee-dee Celtic stylings of Enya (and for that matter, her family’s work on Clannad’s Robin of Sherwood soundtrack a few years earlier). Genre check: is Enya actually New Age, or merely Irish? Well, I’m confident many babies have been birthed (in the light of numerous scented candles) to her soothing, multitracked warbles, so I’m going to say yes.</p>

<p>Is Watermark actually good? Yeah, I reckon. Why not? Can I declare here and now my love for Orinoco Flow? Oh, go on then.</p>

<h1 id="james-holden---the-animal-spirits-2017">James Holden - The Animal Spirits (2017)</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/new-age/the-animal-spirits.jpg" width="300" alt="The Animal Spirits album cover" title="The Animal Spirits" /></p>

<p>James Holden has a storied pedigree as a DJ and remixer with a sideline producing wonky electronica using modular synth(s?). Holden’s album The Animal Spirits was recorded with a band. The result sometimes sounds a bit like Terry Riley, and sometimes it recalls a 1970s psychedelia-infused tribal jazz. The result is really great.</p>

<p>Without knowing more about motivations of Holden and his cadre, I can’t say if The Animal Spirits was intended to be New Age, but I detect a strong sense of English paganism in the music. It’s not necessarily a paganism from the past; it could equally be a paganism of a post-civilisation come-down. Or chalk horses, maybe. Even if the intent and effect is of a different kind to crystals’n’chakras New Age, it still feels like there’s <em>something</em> New Agey there. It’s not just me, right?</p>

<h1 id="popul-vuh---hosianna-mantra-1972">Popul Vuh - Hosianna Mantra (1972)</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/new-age/hosianna-mantra.jpg" width="300" alt="Hosianna Mantra album cover" title="Hosianna Mantra" /></p>

<p>After two albums of Moog doodlings (one average, one pretty good), Popul Vuh’s leader Florian Fricke decided to ditch the electronics and form a band. The concept for Hosianna Mantra was to fuse Eastern and Western religious musical styles. That sounds like a recipe for disaster, but it was the early 70s and Fricke was a Krautrocker, so the result was always going to be more interesting than would appear on paper.</p>

<p>The key to the album’s success is the earnest simplicity of the music. Fricke took maximal advantage of his eclectic arrangement (piano, oboe, guitar, sitar, and - most crucially - the tender, classically-trained voice of Djong Yun). The album is very much of its time, and might be considered naive to modern ears, but I can’t help but admire it as being highly singular and wholly original.</p>

<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>

<p>So there you have it: a bunch of different musics from different times, from musicians with different motivations and backgrounds. We can say then that music that at least I consider to be New Age is not all bad, and I’ve discovered that if you’re creative enough you can transcend the constraints of any genre. Should I have known that already? Probably, yes. But the lesson has been learned, at least for this musical style. Next stop: Christian dubstep!</p>
