  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Growing up in the early 80s I was aware of synthesized sound. I don’t know why I found the bloops interesting - perhaps it was the common presence of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVvdFRtBnMA&amp;t=137s">“synthetic electronic sound”</a> in science fiction TV shows that made it so evocative to me. Older people seemed to find electronic sounds cold and alienating, but for me they were beguiling.</p>

<p>Though I was aware of the early 80s synth pop boom to some degree (I certainly remember when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_You_Want_Me">Don’t You Want Me</a> (1981) came out, and when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Monday_(New_Order_song)">Blue Monday</a> (1983) played in the background at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation_Street">Rover’s Return</a>), I was more focused on electronic musical cues from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who">Doctor Who</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_Rogers_in_the_25th_Century_(TV_series)">Buck Rogers in the 25th Century</a>, or indeed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vangelis">Vangelis</a>’ ubiquitous 1981 synth hit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8a-HfNE3EIo">Chariots of Fire</a>. (I was especially impressed by how Vangelis’ studio setup had him besieged by keyboards.) But more than any of these things, the music I remember most being fascinated was this anonymous but vivid electronica that got played whenever our local television transmitter lost its upstream feed (something that happened at that time more often than you’d think). This anonymous soundtrack featured a blaze of electronic sound which I found captivating and mysterious at the age of I dunno, somewhere between 6 and 8.</p>

<p>I don’t want to over-emphasise my interest in sound - children are fleetingly interested in lots of things. But there was something about it that persisted over time, even if in a minor way compared to say <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket">cricket</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterix">Asterix</a>. I really dug the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_of_Noise">Art of Noise’s</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sFK0-lcjGU">Close to the Edit</a> (1984), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Hardcastle">Paul Hardcastle</a>’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sajngb0W6I">Nineteen</a> (1985). (I wasn’t quite so taken by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yello">Yello</a>’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_Yeah_(Yello_song)">Oh Yeah</a> though.) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump_Up_the_Volume_(song)">Pump up the Volume</a> (1987) was a revelation (though possibly more for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9gOQgfPW4Y">royalty free Nasa footage used in the video</a> than its pioneering house-in-the-charts sound).</p>

<p>In any event, it seems I was primed in some way when, in 1990, I saw an ad on TV for <a href="https://www.discogs.com/release/11210949-Ed-Starink-Synthesizer-Greatest">Synthesiser Greatest</a> (volume 1), a collection of synth hits distributed in my homeland by the cheap and cheerful <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/198393-Dino-Music-Pty-Limited">Dino Records</a>. The ad featured a tune I recognised from the TV transmitter breakdown music. I had never bought music before, but I was sufficiently moved to buy this compilation. And so it was, on my 15th birthday, I acquired Synthesizer Greatest on cassette.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/jmj/synthesizer-greatest.jpg" width="600" alt="Synthesizer Greatest album cover" title="Synthesizer Greatest album cover" /></p>

<p>The album, as I discovered later, featured covers only (boo!) by a Dutchman going by the name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Starink">Ed Starink</a>. (I thought this name was an embarrassing pseudonym, but apparently it isn’t?!) The vibe of the enterprise was pretty cheap and cheesy, and I wouldn’t say it was the sort of thing I’d buy now (or even a year after I bought it). But to be fair the quality of the covers was actually pretty solid, and the tracklist gave me plenty of points for further investigation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Autobahn (Kraftwerk)</li>
  <li>Moments in Love (Art of Noise)</li>
  <li>Electricity (OMD)</li>
  <li>Pulstar (Vangelis)</li>
  <li>Oxygene part IV (Jarre)</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/jmj/synthesizer-greatest-cassette.jpg" alt="Synthesizer Greatest cassette tape" title="This is what a tape looked like, kids" /></p>

<p>Oxygene IV was the track I recognised from the ad, and its composer now had a name: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Michel_Jarre">Jean Michel Jarre</a>. The hunt was on! Over the next couple of years I obtained (new, second hand, or <em>cough</em> dubbed onto tape) ten Jarre albums. This post contains reflections on what I found.</p>

<p>Let’s give it up for Synthesizer Greatest. <em>clap</em> <em>clap</em> <em>clap</em></p>

<h2 id="digression-now-thats-what-i-call-not-now-music">Digression: Now that’s what I call not-now music</h2>

<p>Before we get to the subject at hand, it’s worth pausing to wonder why I was off on this hunt for out-of-date music rather than digging through white label vinyl at the freshest record shop in town? Or to put another way, why the idiosyncratic exploration of sounds I’d heard 10 years earlier? Well, part of the answer is I wasn’t really aware of the contemporary electronic scene at the time. My immediate social circle was obsessed with goth and indie rock, of nearly the same vintage of Jarre’s heyday. Others were listening to Led Zeppelin with the same fervour as Nirvana… In any event I didn’t really interact with contemporary electronica until I reached university.</p>

<p>More generally though, I’ve seldom listened to contemporary music. I tend to be a bit sceptical of novelty until it’s had a chance to percolate. I guess that speaks to an inherent conservatism on my part, and well, yes…</p>

<p>Now, I’ve got that off my chest, let’s explore the disocgraphy of Jean Michel Jarre.</p>

<h1 id="oxygene-1976">Oxygene (1976)</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/jmj/oxygene.jpg" width="300" alt="Oxygene album cover" title="Oxygene album cover" /></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxyg%C3%A8ne">Oxygene</a> wasn’t the first Jarre album I heard, but it makes more sense to start with this album.</p>

<p>My Oxygene year zero was in August 1991. After listening to the Jarre tracks on Synthesizer Greatest, Oxygene became a sort of holy grail for me. Buying it was a bit of a punt because it cost NZ$19.95, which wasn’t that much money then, but on my budget was a fair bit, which could have been spent on two classical cassettes. Would the benefit justify the cost?!</p>

<p>I still get misty eyed remembering it. It was a sunny Wednesday and I caught the lunch time train from school into town for an orthodontist’s appointment, and delayed my return to education by a few minutes to quickly duck into the nearest music shop (of which there were many back then) and buy Oxygene. Braces tightened, teeth hurting, I executed my musical purchase and sprinted back to the station in time for the next train. Once safely onboard, I placed the tape into my mid-price Walkman (no Dolby B noise reduction, but it did have a three band equaliser), and listened through the first side on the train back to school. I remember listening and feeling a sense of relief that I was enjoying it; more than that even, I found the music transcendant. Unfortunately school got in the way of listening all the way through; the second side had to wait until I got home. When I finally had a chance to listen, the experience was just as pleasurable. Jarre got a fan for life that day.</p>

<p>Oxygene part 1 starts with a genial cyclical burble of synths through echoes. Proceedings move around in a plinketty plonketty way. Eventually the fizz evaporates and there’s a subdued, eerie theme. Toward the end the plink-plonks resume to facilitate a more dramatic transition into Part II. Overall part I is a fairly straightforward mood piece, but it sets the scene well.</p>

<p>Part II commences with a series of repeating sequences building up to a crescendo of urgency, before commencing a dramatic melody, punctuated by sine wobbles from a VCS3. This was another theme I remember from TV transmitter breakdown interludes. After the first melody, the track shifts into another theme, which thunders away emphatically with a bit of noodly soloing, until the track fades away into a slow up-and-down sweep of white noise through a <a href="https://www.tonepedia.com/catalog/effects-and-pedals/chorus-and-vibrato/small-stone-v1-1975/">Small Stone phaser</a> (if there was a Nobel Prize for use of audio effects, Jarre deserved one for Services to Phasing on Oxygene and Equinoxe). Part III is a more sedate almost oriental-sounding piece, which ends with a field recording of birdsong. This brings side 1 to a serene conclusion.</p>

<p>Oxygene part IV I already knew from Synthesizer Greatest. I learned a lot later that the Jarre just slowed down <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Butter">Hot Butter</a>’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YK3ZP6frAMc">Popcorn</a>, and - hey presto - futuristic synth majesty. Oxygene V started with what feels almost church music, a slightly ponderous progression of chords, replaced with the same theme sped up, with a bit of moog brassy soloing that sounds reminiscent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Ravel">Ravel</a>’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bol%C3%A9ro">Bolero</a>. Finally part VI is a track whose arrangement screams “cheesy French <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lounge_music">lounge music</a>”, but is played minor-key straight. It’s a very open and ambiguous conclusion to proceedings, which is exactly what the album needs.</p>

<h2 id="waxing-lyrical">Waxing lyrical</h2>

<p>Where to start praising Oxygene? Well, to begin somewhere, the album made a huge impression on 16 year old me. The sound was just so vivid, and spoke to me of a crepuscular world of stone, sky, wood, and water, but devoid of people. It’s the sound of the planet before humans evolved, or the planet that will exist after we’re gone. To continue the pseudo-poetic vein, it’s the sound you’d hear if you could only strip away the overlying noise of human <em>fuss</em>.</p>

<p>Flowery phrasery aside, the genius of Oxygene is that its parts are carefully constructed to enhance each other. Consider the flow of the tracks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Part I is a great introduction</li>
  <li>Part II ups the ante</li>
  <li>Part III provides good contrast and concludes side A perfectly.</li>
  <li>Part IV restarts proceedings dramatically, and is the stand out track (and single)</li>
  <li>Part V begins as a languid change of pace, before stepping up a gear and providing a bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcadia_(utopia)">arcadian</a> longing</li>
  <li>Part VI provides a muted “come-down” to conclude the album.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not only do the moods in this sequence contrast and balance nicely, the continuous mix (aside from the gap between side 1 and 2) seamlessly blends one track into another, making the album feel like a journey.</p>

<p>The sound is incredibly crisp and precise, and clear - despite being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/16/jean-michel-jarre-michel-granger-oxygene">recorded in Jarre’s kitchen</a> rather than in a professional studio. The relative gain levels between the instruments are expertly balanced both in gain and stereo space. Finally, as icing on the cake, there’s Jarre’s winning choice of <a href="http://www.granger-michel.com/project/oxygene-1972/">Michel Granger’s surreal painting</a> for the album cover.</p>

<p>Now I’ll concede that without the nostalgic reference points baked into my head, a contemporary Oxygene listener might not see it as an electronica album for the ages. (They be wondering “where’s the kick drum?”) But for what it’s worth, I reckon Oxygene transcends its era. As a document of 70s electronica at Oxygene is perhaps the most quintessential.</p>

<h2 id="prehistory">Prehistory</h2>

<p>Before we go further, it’s worth pointing out that prior to Oxygene, Jarre had released two previous albums, both in 1973. One was a set of stock music, the other a film soundtrack.</p>

<p>I didn’t get to hear them until the 2010s. I can report they’re pretty average - standard electronic fare for the time, and not compelling enough for a second listen. Yet, in a way, this only serves to make Oxygene more impressive. I’m curious to know what changed in Jarre’s compositional outlook between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Granges_Br%C3%BBl%C3%A9es_(album)">Les Granges Brûlées</a> in 1973, and Oxygene three years later. Was Oxygene as intentional as it seems listening to it now, or was the result more of a happy accident, where the six tracks just happened to work together so well?</p>

<p>He began as he meant to go on.</p>

<h1 id="equinoxe-1978">Equinoxe (1978)</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/jmj/equinoxe.jpg" width="300" alt="Equinoxe album cover" title="Equinoxe album cover" /></p>

<p>Since Oxygene had proven an excellent purchase, I resolved to buy Jarre’s followup, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89quinoxe">Equinoxe</a>. I obtained it the afternoon before I went up country on a trip with my history class. While coach loudspeakers blared out Bob Marley, I cranked up my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkman">Walkman</a> and witnessed Equinoxe for the first time. (Incidentally I’ve held a grudge against Marley fans and boycotted his music ever since - even though I realise it’s hardly his fault. But I’m sure you’ll agree that things that happen at high school really stay with you.)</p>

<p>Equinoxe Part I is a major key fanfare by way of frenzied arpeggiation. It is a more confident, emphatic, and bombastic start to an album than Oxygene’s part I. Part II, by contrast, is haunted phased soundscape. Part III kicks off as a rather lovely waltz, which soon decays into a some sonic brooding and bubbling. Part IV was the album’s most exciting discovery for me - in the early 80s it was used as the title music for a long-running nature documentary series in my country in the early 1980s. Equinoxe was the highlight of my trip - well, that and getting a chance to have a chat with a girl I fancied (I used the opportunity to boast about how much weetbix I could eat. I’ll concede that as romantic openings go, it was absolutely dire.)</p>

<p>Side two begins with Part V, which I’d heard before on Synthesizer Greatest. It’s very much The Single, jaunty and cheerful, directing us towards our Glorious Utopian Future. It’s decent, but doesn’t quite have the resonance of Oxygene IV, though. Part VI keeps up Part V’s tempo, and is really charming in a sample-hold, techno futuristic way.</p>

<p>Part VII starts off with a nice piece of bass work, but develops into an lengthy and slightly underdeveloped workout that doesn’t quite justify its length. Eventually the rhythm, which hasn’t relented since Part V began, eases away. Part VIII starts out with a rendering of synthetic oompah band playing in a thunderstorm - quirky choice, that - before recapitulating Part V’s theme in a churchy kind of way. The conclusion is a kind of uplifting Amen.</p>

<p>Up to part VII Equinoxe was on par in terms of quality to Oxygene; the only detracting point would be that the album cleaves very closely to Oxygene’s template. (That doesn’t particularly bother me; not every album has to be a significant development on the last.) Unfortunately, however, parts VII and VIII, don’t quite see the album out with the same emphaticness that parts V and VI of Oxygene do. It’s not enough to derail the whole work, but it is a shame Jarre ran out of inspiration on the home strait.</p>

<p>Nice cravat.</p>

<h1 id="magnetic-fields-1981">Magnetic Fields (1981)</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/jmj/magnetic-fields.jpg" width="300" alt="Magnetic fields album cover" title="Magnetic fields album cover" /></p>

<p>Magnetic Fields finds Jarre at something of a crossroads. Equinoxe had been a play-it-safe sequel to Oxygene, but by 1981 the electronic music landscape had changed a lot since 1976. Understandably, for his next album, Jarre looked to innovate by obtaining a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairlight_CMI">Fairlight CMI</a>, a fabulously expensive and very much way-of-the-future digital sampler.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the Fairlight only recognisably appears in one or two places on the album (it would be used far more authoritatively on Jarre’s next disc). Instead, the album largely relies on analogue synthesisers.</p>

<p>The first side of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Chants_Magn%C3%A9tiques">Magnetic Fields</a> is taken up by Magnetic Fields part I. In truth Part I is actually three tracks: an initial urgent introduction that gives an impression of relentless motion. Then there’s an interlude of floating music concrete, followed by another minor key romp to the piece’s conclusion. The overall impression I had from first listen is that it just isn’t engaging as the first sides of Oxygene or Equinoxe.</p>

<p>Side two begins (as usual) with a single, the rambunctious Magnetic Fields part II. The track is the first Jarre number to feature percussion up loud in the mix. It’s not a bad track, but it lacks the majestic transcendance of Oxygene IV, or the cheery utopia of Equinoxe part V. Worryingly for Jarre, the version on Synthesizer Greatest is actually better (thumbs up to Ed Starink!).</p>

<p>For me the best track on the album is Magnetic Fields part III. It’s a relatively straightforward mix of spiralling arpeggios, water sploshing, synthetic bass and what could be a slowed thumb piano loop. To me it’s the only track on the album that has any room to breathe.</p>

<p>Part IV is a sort of limp anthem that plods away for a while, modulates into minor key for a further while, and kind of slinks away with a field recording of a train. A bit like Equinoxe part VII it’s not bad, but just not that interesting.</p>

<p>If Part IV is lacklustre, part V (named on a later Jarre compilation as “The Last Rumba”) is, like Oxygene Part VI a lounge music excursion. But while its predecessor has a contemplative, even melancholic tone, The Last Rumba is profoundly cheesy, and doesn’t bear repeated listening.</p>

<p>Magnetic Fields for me is Jarre’s difficult third album. Jarre clearly wanted to move into new territory with Magnetic Fields, but the result was a bit crap. If you want to look at genuinely innovative 1981 electronic albums, consider Kraftwerk’s Computerworld, where they basically invented techno. By contrast, the lumpy style of Magnetic Fields
didn’t lead to anything.</p>

<h2 id="embarrassing-music-video-2">Embarrassing music video</h2>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w434qhNJMdw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Embarrassing, yes, but an improvement on before.</p>

<h1 id="zoolook-1984">Zoolook (1984)</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/jmj/zoolook.jpg" width="300" alt="Zoolook album cover" title="Zoolook album cover" /></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoolook">Zoolook</a> was the first Jarre album I listened to, obtaining it on CD from my local library in early 1991. It’s perhaps not the most appropriate introduction to Jarre’s music, but in a way that makes it a more interesting starting point. I remember sticking the CD into the player, donning some ridiculously large 70s headphones and almost immediately hearing sounds I’d never heard before.</p>

<p>For Zoolook Jarre had another crack reinventing his sound, and features collaborations with musicians as unexpected as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_Anderson">Laurie Anderson</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Belew">Adrian Belew</a>. The Fairlight CMI, used somewhat timidly in Magnetic Fields, was front and centre on Zoolook. (Apparently the first version of the Fairlight didn’t have a sequencer, and this may account for its limited use on the earlier album, and greater prominence here.) Also in contrast to earlier albums, the primary musical medium of Zoolook is the human voice, sampled and processed.</p>

<p>The first track, Ethnicolor, is a psychedelic, Vangelistic (Vangelisian?) excursion quite unlike anything Jarre had produced before. The clarity of makes a welcome return, the digital technology providing a crisper frequency response than Magnetic Fields’ wall of arpeggiating synths. The sound is greatly modernised, with live drums filtered through gated reverb in a typically mid 80s style. Slap bass even makes an appearance, as welcome as it is surprising. The only downside to the track is that the early melody is played through a vocal sample that sounds like “tit”.</p>

<p>The next track, Diva, featuring Laurie Anderson on vocals, begins with a languorous introduction, followed by a more frenetic workout propped up by african-style drumming and guitar. That’s not a description that sounds promising, but it really works.</p>

<p>There follows the title track, which is a piece of excellent synth funk(!), slightly reminiscent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbie_Hancock">Herbie Hancock</a>’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockit_(instrumental)">Rockit</a> (esp the music video), but also sufficiently its own thing not to excite Hancock’s lawyers.</p>

<p>Then there’s the spooky dreamtime evocation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolloomooloo">Woolloomooloo</a>. I actually think it’s one of Jarre’s best tracks. Just so well realised.</p>

<p>After that comes Zoolookologie, a fizzing pop track which zings away happily, its only blemish being a recapitulation of that distracting “tit” sample from Ethnicolor.</p>

<p>Heading into the home straight, there’s Blah Blah Cafe, a stomping piece of silliness, that has a similar function to The Last Rumba on Magnetic Fields, only it isn’t fucking terrible.</p>

<p>The final track is the grave, contemplative Ethnicolor II, which is the perfect sendoff for the album.</p>

<p>Zoolook is - to me at least - Jarre’s second best album after Oxygene. What I admire most about it is that Jarre completely reinvented his sound and approach, and it completely pays off.</p>

<p>This is actually not too bad, so as a bonus, here’s one that’s much worse:</p>

<p>DID YOU KNOW THIS WAS MADE IN THE 1980s?</p>

<h1 id="rendez-vous-1986">Rendez-Vous (1986)</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/jmj/rendez-vous.jpg" width="300" alt="Rendez-Vous album cover" title="Rendez-Vous album cover" /></p>

<p>With Zoolook marking a much-needed fresh start to Jarre’s career, his next album capitalised on this by creating a remarkable fusion of jazz and ambient electronica which both looked back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Davis">Miles Davis</a>’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_a_silent_way">In a Silent Way</a>, and forward to the 90s Ambient movement.</p>

<p>Well, that’s the album I’d like for him to have made. But he didn’t. In fact, what happened next was pretty dire.</p>

<h2 id="houston-calling">Houston calling</h2>

<p>Rendez-Vous has a bit of a backstory you need to understand before we can discuss it, so settle in. It all started when Jarre was invited to perform in Houston for a celebration of 25 years of Nasa and 150 years of Texas. The performance was to be played in front of a massive audience, with a light show beamed across skyscrapers in the centre of Houston.</p>

<p>This scenario might seem a bit random, but that’s because I’ve neglected to mention Jarre’s concert exploits. On Bastille Day 1979 he performed in Paris to an audience of 1 million, putting him into the Guinness Book of Records. In 1981 he gave a series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Concerts_en_Chine">concerts in China</a>, these being the first western performances in China since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution">Cultural Revolution</a>. These experiences made Jarre somewhat credible as a booking for the Houston concert. Perhaps Houston natives <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZZ_Top">ZZ Top</a> would have been a more appropriate choice, but Jarre got the invitation anyway.</p>

<p>For the concert, called Rendez-Vous Houston, Jarre went all-in, producing a new album (called Rendez-Vous, naturally) to release on the same day as the performance (you need to capitalise on these opportunities, right?). He also worked with astronaut and saxonphonist Ron McNair to prepare a piece McNair would record while in orbit on the space shuttle. Preparations went well until McNair died in the Challenger disaster in January 1986. A disconsolate Jarre wanted to pull the plug on the project, but was persuaded to continue. Even so, the concert was plagued with problems ahead of the performance. The concert happened, despite the fire brigade taking an understandably jaundiced view of fireworks ash raining down on the crowd. In the end Jarre was able to advance his personal concert attendance record from 1 to 1.3 million people.</p>

<h2 id="a-digression-on-authenticity-in-jarres-live-performances">A digression on authenticity in Jarre’s live performances</h2>

<p>Jarre’s early live performances were a bit cagey because, while there were some live elements - notably percussion - much of the music was lifted from his studio albums. Now there is some practical necessity in this in that it was very difficult to replicate a multitrack recording live, esp with the limitations of 80s synth hardware. So I could give it a pass on the basis that the performance was a blend of backing track and some live sound. (For an example of this done right, see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8TXjhWCQPE">Depeche Mode’s 101 concert</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/s4199VMeeQc?t=389">Fletch’s uncertain contributions</a> not withstanding.)</p>

<p>When I turned 17 I shelled out for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYio7l7B940">VHS tape of Jarre’s Houston performance</a>. Now it may be a function of the video edit but what Jarre appeared to be doing on stage had no correlation to the music, leaving me wondering if Jarre was merely pretending. (To be fair, the vid does suggest Jarre’s semi-circular keyboard controlled the lighting in some way, but that also seems a bit of a cop out.)</p>

<p>I’m not alone in this view. The normally genial UK comedian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Bailey">Bill Bailey</a> was moved to declare that “Jean Michel Jarre is a fraud”.</p>

<p>Listening to the FM broadcast of the concert confirms Bailey’s allegations. Much of the music is tracks lifted from Jarre albums. So seeing Jarre prancing around in that video was the point that I rather lost faith in him.</p>

<h2 id="rendezvous-with-rendez-vous">Rendezvous with Rendez-Vous</h2>

<p>Rendez-Vous the album is a slight nod to the past (coming ten years after the release of Oxygene, it uses a new Michel Grainger painting on its cover, and features 6 tracks like Oxygene). But unlike the later Oxygene 7-13 album, the music and tone is unrelated. Instead, Rendez-Vous takes in a new stylistic departure: bombast. Now ok, there had been slightly operatic moments of drama in Jarre’s earlier work, most notably on Zoolook, but Rendez-Vous goes truly over the top, and not in a good way. But the most egregious horror is the saccharine Fourth Rendez-Vous. I’d heard this all the way back on Synthesizer Greatest and thought it a bit trite (or as trite as a 15 year old can find anything), but embedded in its parent album, it’s just the worst.</p>

<p>The only track I find reasonably decent is the closer, Final Rendez-Vous. This is the track that was to feature McNair’s saxophone. In his honour the track is subtitled Ron’s Theme. It’s an effective track, if more melodramatic than I prefer.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, it’s slim pickings. Compared to the lush arrangement of Zoolook, the sound in Rendez-Vous is stripped back, and more synth-oriented than Zoolook. The album feels a bit underproduced, too.</p>

<p>Why is Rendez-vous so bad? And why did Jarre turn his back on the creatively rich sound world of Zoolook? There’s so many possible reasons: perhaps Zoolook was costly to produce, didn’t sell as well as previous albums, and Jarre felt obliged to make his next album more commercial. Perhaps he was simply pushed for time producing Rendez-Vous for the concert, and cut a few corners with the arrangement. Regardless of what I might speculate, the album sold 3 million copies and - lamentably - set the tone for Jarre’s next album, Revolutions.</p>

<p>So bad.</p>

<h1 id="revolutions-1988">Revolutions (1988)</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/jmj/revolutions.jpg" width="300" alt="Revolutions album cover" title="Revolutions album cover" /></p>

<p>Revolutions is a kind of retread of Rendez-Vous, this time focusing on various social, political, and technological revolutions. Thematically this seems like a rich starting point, and the album certainly tries to cover a lot of ground. The sound is a bit more developed, this time, with arguably the best percussion patterns of Jarre’s career.</p>

<p>So that’s all good. But the bombast is still prevalent, and there’s clearly an eye to another concert (this time the comparatively under-attended Destination Docklands in London in 1988).</p>

<p>While Revolutions is largerly dire, there is one unreservedly decent track: the uneasy and saxy Tokyo Kid. In keeping with the Japanese theme, I think this piece would be quite at home on the soundtrack of a dystopian anime like Akira or Ghost in the Shell - high praise, but justified, I think. So good work on that one at least, Jean Michel.</p>

<p>But the rest of the album… ugh. The nadir is September, a tribute to an ANC activist assassinated in Paris in 1988. The tribute idea is of course perfectly decent, but the tune is so sugary it’s impossible to take. Furthermore there’s a singer belting out a gospel solo in the manner of Clare Torry on Pink Floyd’s The Great Gig in the Sky. This is one instance where Jarre’s “borrowing” doesn’t lead to a decent result.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/jmj/waiting-for-cousteau.jpg" width="300" alt="Waiting for cousteau album cover" title="Waiting for cousteau album cover" /></p>

<p>An album in tribute to scuba-diving mariner Jacques Cousteau, side one features something no one asked for: Jarre’s take on Calypso music (quelle horreur!). Side 2 features the long, ambient title track, which is pretty decent, if derivative of Brian Eno’s dreary Thursday Afternoon-style ambience.</p>

<p>Music’s not great, but give it up to the animators!</p>

<h1 id="chronologie-1993">Chronologie (1993)</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/jmj/chronologie.jpg" width="300" alt="Chronologie album cover" title="Chronologie album cover" /></p>

<p>Chronologie (a concept album about Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of time, apparently) is better, but nowhere near Jarre’s best. There’s a few half-hearted nods to contemporary electronic dance, but otherwise it’s all business-as-usual.</p>

<p>I have fonder feelings towards this album than perhaps I should, because I bought it while on a highly enjoyable holiday in Australia.</p>

<h2 id="embarassing-music-video">Embarassing music video</h2>

<p>More boring than embarrassing, really, save for the moment where Jarre spins around to face the camera in a manner reminiscent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garth_Marenghi%27s_Darkplace">Garth Marenghi</a>.</p>

<h1 id="oxygene-7-13-1997">Oxygene 7-13 (1997)</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/jmj/oxygene-7-13.jpg" width="300" alt="Oxygene 7-13 album cover" title="Oxygene 7-13 album cover" /></p>

<p>Jarre didn’t release any new material for four years and I largely moved on from him. But when I discovered Oxygene 7-13 existed, I was sufficiently curious to obtain the album.</p>

<p>Brought out for the 20th anniversary of Oxygene, the new instalment was a return to that sound world, with Jarre utilising (mostly) the same synthesizers.</p>

<p>The first track (part VII, continuing on from the six parts of the original album), is an absolute tour de force, one of the best tracks Jarre has produced. Listening to it the first time was a bit like the return of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Prodigal_Son">Prodigal Son</a>. Part VIII is the obligatory single in the vein of Oxygene part IV: it’s not terrible, but a bit arthritic for the age in which it was produced.</p>

<p>The rest of the album doesn’t have the same vitality, but isn’t bad by any means, and Oxygene 7 - 13 must overall be considered a return to genuine form. And yet, well, when you get down to it musical sequels (Tubular Bells II is another example, maybe Bat out of Hell 2, too?!) are creatively redundant, and a bit self-indulgent. Also, Jarre had already produced an Oxygene sequel in the form of Equinoxe, so why go back there in 1997, or again in 2016, with Oxygene 3? Nostalgia and sales.</p>

<h2 id="not-embarrassing-music-video-1">Not embarrassing music video</h2>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lVEAk5Lpwf0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>No embarrassment in this video, but not much of anything else, either.</p>

<h1 id="the-latter-years">The latter years</h1>

<p>Perhaps five years ago I gave Jarre’s 2000s work a cursory listen through on Spotify. I both don’t remember and didn’t think very much of it. Then there’s the huge Electronica compilation: a series of collaborations with other electronic luminaries. If you’re feeling charitable, such a project is an admirable piece of outreach and limelight sharing; more cynically it could be viewed as a waning talent collaborating to maintain relevancy.</p>

<p>In more recent years, however, Jarre has experienced a relative renaissance: Equinoxe Infinity is actually pretty listenable, and Oxygene 3, while more dour than I’d prefer, is decent enough. But for me the stand out album of the past three (nearly four) decades is the 2021 album Amazonia. Intended as background music to a photographic exhibition, it’s a vivid and revelatory piece of ambient music, featuring numerous field recordings from the Amazon basin. It’s a mix of Zoolook and Waiting for Cousteau, more understated than the former, and less rigid than the latter. All the while it dodges the well-worn paths of Deep Forest and Enigma. To my mind it’s the most successful Jarre’s been at engaging with the minimal sensibility of the last 30 years of electronica. Sadly he followed it up with a VR performance in Notre Dame, or somesuch. But still, it gives me encouragement that something new of interest might come out in future, though Jarre is pushing 75.</p>

<h1 id="what-to-make-of-it-all">What to make of it all</h1>

<p>I think it would be fair to say that the work of Jean Michel Jarre has left me with mixed feelings. Looking at it really positively, Jarre’s music taught me a lot about what I liked and disliked in music generally: Oxygene and Zoolook I enjoyed without reservation, and will happily defend to this day. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZivR39Opmo&amp;t=60s">The overly cheesy synth solo on Industrial Revolution</a> I enjoyed on first listen, but eventually I came to see as hollow and unearned (nice performance from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Art_(band)">Dominique Perrier</a>, though). As for Rendez-Vous Part IV, well I always found that as intellectually and emotionally as nutritious as cardboard.</p>

<p>But having listened to a lot of electronic music since then (mostly 1970 - 2000), I will say that at his best, Jarre is a genuine giant. And at his worst, he’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurotrash_(term)">Eurotrash</a> producer of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirque_du_Soleil">Cirque du Soleil</a> background music. Now I suppose his commitment to demotic electronica is admirably of-the-people, but that doesn’t detract from the resulting music being emotionally shallow and frequently embarrassing. It seems to me that Jarre really wanted to be a rock star, and boy was that an instinct he should have resisted.</p>

<p>It’s interesting to compare Jarre with his fellow travellers. But who exactly are they? Growing up, Vangelis seemed to be his most obvious peer, but with greater familiarity of the Greek master’s work, he was more varied and less electronic than he superifically seemed. (Boy could he make some amazing sounds with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_CS-80">CS-80</a>, though…) Since I recently wrote about Tangerine Dream, lets compare Jarre compare with Tangerine Dream founder Edgar Froese? The difference in temperament is amusingly stereotypical: Jarre and his Gallic flair versus the phlemagtically earnest German Froese. I’d say Jarre is probably a more talented composer, but Froese had the more clear-minded ethos behind his work. Indeed, aside from the ecological motivations behind Oxygene (and Michel Granger’s remarkable cover painting), Jarre’s career seems to have been an endless search for a <em>raison d’etre</em>.</p>

<p>A less contemporaenous but more apt comparison might be with the American producer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby">Moby</a>, who has had similar lapses in taste, and who also desperately wants to be a star. This time Jarre comes off rather better for the comparison; flawed as he is, he’s never been as undignified as Moby.</p>

<p>Regardless of how mixed I’ve found Jarre’s legacy, he’s one of life’s winners, anyway, so you know, <em>french shrug</em>.</p>
