    <p>After a cheery frolic through the worlds of JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure and K-pop, I turn now to something very serious indeed: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangerine_Dream">Tangerine Dream</a>.</p>

<p>For those who haven’t yet made Tangerine Dream their personal religion, they were (at least for the period in which I am interested in them) an electronic rock group. Founded and principally organised by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Froese">Edgar Froese</a>, Tangerine Dream were stalwarts of the so-called (but not by the participants) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krautrock">Krautrock</a> movement. They formed in Berlin in the late 1960s, and are still a going concern today. In all Tangerine Dream has released in excess of a hundred of studio and concert albums, as well as numerous film soundtracks. Of this total output I’ve heard perhaps 10%, because my primary interest is in the group’s early 1970s albums (what I’ll call the “classic” period), which have had a profound influence on my thinking about music, and indeed the cosmos.</p>

<h1 id="my-personal-dreamtime">My personal dreamtime</h1>

<p>For whatever reason I always found electronic sound interesting, and started actively investigating it from the age of 15. I can’t remember how I learned of Tangerine Dream’s existence. Maybe it was because their CDs frequently turned up in the library category “electronic”. Whatever the reason I started listening to Tangerine Dream from early 1992.</p>

<p>In the age of Spotify I can find and listen to Tangerine Dream’s albums in seconds, but in the early 90s physical media was all there was, and there wasn’t much available at that. I could have ordered what I wanted through music shops on “import”, but I didn’t have the money to pay the required premium. To be more scrupulously honest I had money but optimised my spending - where quality was even - on quantity. I could buy three classical music tapes for one import CD, so I did that.</p>

<p>The upshot is that I had to be patient. One thing to be said about this scenario is that it made me continually hungry for music in a way I am not today. (I want to add a sentence about how this gave kids of my generation moral fibre which today’s youth lack. Oh, it turns out I have added this sentence. Well, let me add the caveat that I mean it only half seriously.)</p>

<p>Because I had to take what I could find, my initial sampling of Tangerine Dream’s works was quite random. It soon became clear that the group’s music came in two categories: the 1970s albums that I mostly found Very Interesting, and the 1980s albums that tended to be Bland and Uninteresting. I now provide a survey of albums in the former category.</p>

<h2 id="phaedra">Phaedra</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/td/phaedra.png" width="300" alt="Phaedra album cover" title="Phaedra album cover" /></p>

<p>Unlike electronic music I’d listened to previously (Vangelis, Jean Michel Jarre), which was orderly and reasonably pleasant, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaedra_(album)">Phaedra</a> was something new: scary. Phaedra’s eponymous track, dribbled in uneasily out of silence, with a sinister repeating cascade of notes soon dominating. This melodic tumble gradually evolved, becoming faster and losing its tuning (voltage-controlled synthesizers were notorious for this), before expiring into a bleak soundscape haunted by demented howlings.</p>

<p>The rest of the album’s tracks weren’t quite as hypnotically terrifying, but just as impactful. The unsnappily named “Mysterious Semblance at the Strand of Nightmares” sounded to me like an organist warming up to play at my funeral, while “Movements of a Visionary” skittled and rattled with agreeable mania. The short finale, “Sequent C” ended the album on a desolate and comfortless note. It was a vivid experience and I was instantly hooked.</p>

<p>I pored over album’s liner notes. The three members (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Franke">Chris Franke</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Baumann">Peter Baumann</a>, and founder Froese) all seemed to be playing something called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMS_VCS_3">VCS3</a>, and something that was science fictionally named “mellotron”. Finally, Chris Franke played an instrument called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moog_synthesizer">Moog synthesizer</a>. None of this meant anything to me, but I was deeply impressed.</p>

<p>Phaedra was uncompromising but I found in it something of me, or something that, through familiarity, felt me-ish. It might have helped that at the time I was suffering from (in my unprofessional estimation) clinical depression; I was certainly finding the latter half of my teen years quite trying. I don’t want to over-stress this, as I think most teenagers are on the edge of some mental crisis or another - it’s a pretty trying time for everyone. But I think my personal gloom does explain my attraction to Phaedra: the baleful mood of the album provided me with a kind of solace. (At the time, other kids were probably deriving the same sort of consolation from say Nirvana, but I found Nirvana nihilistic and comfortless.)</p>

<h2 id="zeit">Zeit</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/td/zeit.png" width="300" alt="Zeit album cover" title="Zeit album cover" /></p>

<p>Four months later in August ‘92 that I hit my next Tangerine Dream jackpot: the 1972 double album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeit_(Tangerine_Dream_album)">Zeit</a> (German for time, if you weren’t aware) on glorious single cassette. Playing it revealed (rather hissily) 70 minutes of cosmic mystery, or, as the group pretentiously subtitled it, “a largo in four movements”.</p>

<p>I listened to Zeit for the first time in my bedroom on a Saturday afternoon. Outside it was a brightly sunny winter’s day, but inside my room the tension was building. As the first cello drones of the first track (“Birth of the Liquid Pleiades”, is the un-understated title), my mood was so hyperbolically neurotic that I was convinced the music was going to drive me mad. But I persisted, and the searing battle between four cellos and a Moog synthesizer eventually subsided into a more peaceful organ interlude. The next track, “Nebulous Dawn” was a more straightforward alien soundscape: a bit like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bebe_and_Louis_Barron#Forbidden_Planet">Barrons’ soundtrack to Forbidden Planet</a>. It conveyed what its title suggests, but I found it a little static for its length, and I think it’s the weakest of the four “movements”.</p>

<p>Turning the tape over, the third track, “Origin of Supernatural Probabilities”, had much more propulsion, with hypnotic synth burbling dominating proceedings, bookended by mysterious guitar chords. It was the most dynamic track on the album. Finally, there’s the title track, a cold, cosmic shimmer, occasionally intruded by the plaintive squeals of what sounded to me like a dying cat. Then it gradually faded away, like the heat death of the universe, but also strangely cathartic. After the tape ran out, I felt strangely triumphant. I’d survived the encounter, and felt transformed by the journey.</p>

<p>Zeit has become for me a sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_Island_Discs">Desert Island Disc</a>. It’s not necessarily better than Phaedra, but it had a greater emotional impact on me. It’s the sort of album that I’d hope would be playing me out as I shuffle off into eternity.</p>

<h2 id="electronic-meditation">Electronic Meditation</h2>

<p>The next Tangerine Dream album I caught up with was the band’s first, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Meditation">Electronic Meditation</a>, from 1970. From the title I was expecting to hear a Zeit-like ambient exploration, but what I heard was fairly middling stoner rock, with not a single bloop in earshot. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conrad_Schnitzler">Conrad Schnitzler</a>’s manic cello sawing is admirable, but there’s just too much hippie flutework. (It’s not I dislike rock flutes - mad respect for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Anderson">Ian Anderson</a> - it’s just that in this case it wasn’t up to much.)</p>

<p>In Tangerine Dream’s defence, I’ve discovered since that the album title was supplied by their label boss, and the recordings were demos not intended by the band for release.</p>

<h2 id="atem">Atem</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/td/atem.png" width="300" alt="Atem album cover" title="Atem album cover" /></p>

<p>In ~November 1992 I accessed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atem_(album)">Atem</a> through my friend Mike Lindley. He played it through to me and embarrassed me a bit by pointing out at one point a fizz of white noises sounded like someone having a shower (he was right). The album kicked off with thunderous drumming and organwork which reached a crescendo before falling away. The rest of the track was a Zeit-like eerie reverie. Splendid stuff! The second track, Fauni Gena, was sort of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pr%C3%A9lude_%C3%A0_l%27apr%C3%A8s-midi_d%27un_faune">Prélude à l’après-midi d’un faune</a> but with actual nature recordings and rather more sinister undertones. “Circulation of Events” is a further droney meditation, while the finale, Wahn, is a short burst of tribal drumming and shouting that brings proceedings to a dramatic close.</p>

<p>Rather strangely Atem became for me a soundtrack for the summer of 1992-1993.</p>

<h2 id="alpha-centauri">Alpha Centauri</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/td/alpha-centauri.png" width="300" alt="Alpha Centauri album cover" title="Alpha Centauri album cover" /></p>

<p>It was another year before I found my next classic Tangerine Dream album. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Centauri_(album)">Alpha Centauri</a> from 1971 still predates Tangerine Dream’s wholesale taking up of synthesisers. There’s still rather too much flute action, and listless jamming, but the band has least ascended into out of space, and the album is more thought out than its predecessor, Electronic Meditation. All up it’s a transitional album: not quite top tier but still a lot of fun.</p>

<h2 id="rubycon">Rubycon</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/td/rubycon.png" width="300" alt="Rubycon album cover" title="Rubycon album cover" /></p>

<p>Rubycon was Tangerine Dream’s followup to Phaedra, featuring two long sides of lushly produced sequencer-propelled music. It’s a prototype for what is called (rather pompously to my mind) the ‘Berlin School’ style, popularised more by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Schulze">Klaus Schulze</a> (recently RIP, an early member of Tangerine Dream) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_G%C3%B6ttsching">Manuel Gottsching</a> (Schulze’s bandmate in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash_Ra_Tempel">Ash Ra Tempel</a>).</p>

<p>When I first listened to Rubycon (parts 1 and 2) on my 20th birthday in 1995, I found the album a bit disappointing because the two sides have largely identical structures, and I found that quite flat compared to the variety of previous albums. Over time I’ve come to appreciate the album more (it’s great to work to), but I would say it’s the weakest of the ‘72 - ‘75 albums.</p>

<h2 id="stratosfear">Stratosfear</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/td/stratosfear.png" width="300" alt="Stratosfear album cover" title="Stratosfear album cover" /></p>

<p>1976’s Stratosfear marked a stylistic change into what I would dismiss as “synth prog”. Gone were the ambiguous drone washes and bloopy bits, and in came focused arrangements and guitar licks intended to sound like guitar. Stratosfear acts as a kind of bookend in that it was with this album that “classic” Tangerine Dream abruptly ended.</p>

<h2 id="thru-metamorphic-rock">Thru Metamorphic Rock</h2>

<p>One night in ‘93 I tape-recorded an ambientish show on my local student radio station. It was so late at I went to bed after pressing record. When I listened back I heard some ambienty/world music tracks for a while, and then this new, dramatic piece. It began with a whooshing, skittering noise rhythm, soon followed by a propulsive, emphatic sequencer burble which cascaded urgently for about ten minutes. I thought “wow, this is great”.</p>

<p>The DJ didn’t announce what the track’s name was - it’s possible they had fallen asleep at the mixer - so I had no idea at the time what the music was and who it was by. I guessed it was contemporary, not really knowing what contemporary sounded like. Thereafter I’d play the recording back every so often, wondering whether I’d ever find out who made it.</p>

<p>Perhaps a year later, I stayed up late one night to watch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Mann">Michael Mann</a>’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thief_(film)">Thief</a> solely because it had a Tangerine Dream score. About halfway through I was astonished to hear the track I’d recorded off the radio, playing during a tense scene where safe-cracker <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Caan">James Caan</a> is racing against time to break into a bank vault. I was astonished. Of course it was Tangerine Dream! How could I not know it was Tangerine Dream?</p>

<p>With further investigation I found out the extremely apt name for this track: Thru Metamorphic Rock. The track originally appeared on the band’s 1979 Force Majeure album. The rest of the record is sort of synthy prog rock so the sequencer fury of the track proper is something of an outlier, hearking back to the Phaedra/Rubycon era.</p>

<h1 id="who-the-band-were">Who the band were</h1>

<p>I’ve rambled on about Tangerine Dream’s albums without really going into who they were and their historical context. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangerine_Dream">Wikipedia will do a better job</a>, but I’m also happy to give you my take.</p>

<p>Tangerine Dream were part of a wider movement of experimental German rock in the late 60s and early 70s, designated in English by the slightly perjorative (if memorable) term “Krautrock”. The Krautrock groups were influenced by a heady combination of Anglo-American psychedelic rock and the European avant-garde, but eventually developed their own original voices and wonderful and varied music.</p>

<p>The early Tangerine Dream sound of (at least that recorded on their first album, Electronic Meditation) seems heavily influenced by contemporary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd">Pink Floyd</a>, and this influence continued to be felt in Tangerine Dream’s classic albums. (To my mind Tangerine Dream eclipsed the Floyd, in that they did the stuff I like about Floyd - cosmic wonder and out there sounds - better than Floyd did, while steering clear of Floyd’s blues-bound psychedelia and dreary middle-class miserablism. Pink Floyd fans may disagree…)</p>

<p>Tangerine Dream’s second album, Alpha Centauri, was still identifiably rock, but a cosmic focus was now apparent, and you can hear hints of the sound to come. By 1972 and Zeit, all rock instrumentation had been dispensed with (save for some sparingly used guitar) and the album’s sound was primarily built from long organ drones and synth wobbles. Double albums were a bit of early 70s prog indulgence, but I think Zeit was a statement that genuinely needed the extra run time. Given what had gone before, it was a very audacious change of direction.</p>

<p>Atem was a return to more structured sound (and the return of drumming, if more tribal than rock), but Zeit had indelibly changed the group’s trajectory. Atem is a more straightforward album than Zeit, but still a world removed from Alpha Centauri. The quality is about the same as Zeit, and perhaps a little more assured.</p>

<p>After many years operating in relative obscurity in the German underground scene, Tangerine Dream eventually found success in the UK after being championed by influential DJ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Peel">John Peel</a>, and then signed to Virgin Records. With Phaedra’s release the group found itself having a genuine UK hit (it reached number 15 in the UK album charts, which is a credit to the open-mindedness of the music-buying public of the time). Successful Europeans and (crucially) American tours followed, and Tangerine Dream began composing Hollywood film soundtracks, starting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Friedkin">William Friedkin</a>’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorcerer_(soundtrack)">Sorcerer</a> in 1977. Meanwhile, the group adapted to changes in technology and taste in the 1980s by forging a crystalline, new-Age-friendly musical style. The group have maintained a consistent following ever since.</p>

<p>In recent years the relevance of Tangerine Dream has arguably increased. The recent craze for DIY modular synthesizers represents a return to vogue of 1970s synth production. (It’s questionable whether the resulting music represents any advance on what Tangerine Dream and other groups achieved 50 years ago.) More directly, the Tangerine Dream’s work has been used in media like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_V">Grand Theft Auto</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Stranger_Things">Stranger Things</a>.</p>

<h1 id="later-archaeological-discoveries">Later archaeological discoveries</h1>

<p>Back to my personal history with Tangerine Dream. After my early to mid 90s exploration of the, there was a long period where I didn’t find any new material. Starting in the late 2000s, and through to today, however, I’ve periodically collected more artefacts from the group’s classic period.</p>

<h2 id="tangerine-tree-and-leaves">Tangerine Tree (and leaves)</h2>

<p>In the late 2000s I learned that in the early 2000s many live recordings of Tangerine Dream concerts had been collected and released gratis (with the band’s blessing). This project, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangerine_Tree">Tangerine Tree</a> contains a handful of recordings from the band’s classic era:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lB1yt7YkkQ">pre-Zeit concert in Frankfurt</a> (1971)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFl5vmA8LJE">Some feline groaning in Ossiach</a> (1971)</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.voices-in-the-net.de/ttree052.htm">“Klangwald?”</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbuZ6qpW-m4">performance?</a> (1972)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqJUoNl0hB4">Saint Ouen</a> (1973)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCPLrJvhSLU">Berlin</a> (1973)</li>
</ul>

<p>Because Tangerine Dream’s music of the time was completely improvised, each concert is pretty much unique. Better still, the artistic quality - if not the recording quality - is high, so these recordings represent a significant expansion of Tangerine Dream’s recorded work. For me they have been a welcome discovery in middle age.</p>

<h2 id="soundtracks">Soundtracks</h2>

<p>There are also a couple of soundtracks Tangerine Dream made during the classic era that are worth checking out:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3-83fTszRc">Vampira soundtrack</a> (1971) - proto-Zeit soundtrack to what I guess would be a vampire movie. Feels more H.P. Lovecraft than Bela Lugosi, and that’s a good thing.</li>
  <li>Oedipus Tyrannus - See below.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="edgars-solo-albums">Edgar’s solo albums</h2>

<p>In addition to Tangerine Tree, there’s also Edgar Froese’s three mid-70s solo albums, which further expand the classic Tangerine Dream corpus.</p>

<h3 id="aqua">Aqua</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/td/aqua.jpg" width="300" alt="Aqua album cover" title="Aqua album cover" /></p>

<p>Froese’s first solo album is 1974’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_(Edgar_Froese_album)">Aqua</a>. It’s a pretty solid collection, commencing with the swirly, side-spanning title track. Flipping the disc over and there’s the warm, robust, hypnotic burbles of Berlin-soundy Panorphelia. After the suitably galactic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_891">NGC 891</a>, the album is concluded with the pulsing Upland.</p>

<p>Aqua was recorded roughly around the time of Phaedra, which I find fascinating because the album has nothing of Phaedra’s bleak intensity.</p>

<h3 id="epsilon-in-malaysian-pale">Epsilon in Malaysian Pale</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/td/epsilon-in-malaysian-pale.jpg" width="300" alt="Epsilon in Malaysian Pale cover" title="Epsilon in Malaysian Pale cover" /></p>

<p>1975’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsilon_in_Malaysian_Pale">Epsilon in Malaysian Pale</a> (Epsilon in Malaysian Pale) is strikingly similar to Rubycon, in that both albums consist of two side-long sequencer-driven tracks. But the albums differ in two respects: the arrangement and production on Epsilon in Malaysian Pale is more rudimentary: at one point the tape signal drops out completely. (All of Tangerine Dream’s early albums were comparatively low-fi; Rubycon is the first to avoid loudness clipping, obvious edits, or, in Zeit’s case, the sound of a creaking chair caught on microphone.) It’s tempting to wonder if Epsilon in Malaysian Pale started life as a demo for Rubycon.</p>

<p>The second difference is that despite Rubycon being considerably more polished, Epsilon in Malaysian Pale feels more dynamic and substantial. I don’t know exactly which album was recorded first, but Epsilon in Malaysian Pale feels like a sketch for Rubycon. If so, the sketch turned out better than the finished product.</p>

<p>Epsilon in Malaysian Pale was championed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie">David Bowie</a> as the soundtrack to his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie#1976%E2%80%931979:_Berlin_era">time in Berlin</a> in the late 1970s, and I think the album’s cathartic mood maps well to Bowie’s Berlin rehabilitation after years of drug abuse and rock’n’roll chaos. (Supplemental factoid: Edgar Froese helped Bowie find a flat in Berlin).</p>

<h3 id="macula-transfer-and-stuntman">Macula Transfer and Stuntman</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/td/macular-transfer.jpg" width="300" alt="Macula Transfer album cover" title="Macula Transfer album cover" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/td/stuntman.jpg" width="300" alt="Stuntman album cover" title="Stuntman album cover" /></p>

<p>Froese’s 1976 album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macula_Transfer">Macula Transfer</a> is also worth checking out. It’s not as accomplished as Aqua or Epsilon in Malaysian Pale, and it’s slightly transitional, but it retains enough of the classic sound to be considered part of what I might call the “supporting” canon.</p>

<p>There’s one other Froese composition of interest: the title track from his 1979 album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuntman_(Edgar_Froese_album)">Stuntman</a>. By this stage Froese had switched to a formal (as in structured), commercially-oriented style almost diametrically opposed to the freeform explorations of Zeit and Atem. But Stuntman’s title track is a winningly cheerful burble that is both <em>sooo</em> 70s but also from the glorious future that never was. (Oddly, I first heard the Stuntman track all the way back in 1987 when it was used as the theme music to the BBC Science Magazine radio programme. I didn’t know it was Edgar until 30 years later, but after the Thru Metamorphic Rock episode, I took this discovery more in my stride.)</p>

<p>Froese’s classic era solo works help us measure his contribution to the overall sound of the band. While the production on Aqua and Epsilon in Malaysian Pale is more stripped back, the mood is sufficiently similar to Tangerine Dream to suggest (in the absence of solo material from Franke and Baumann during the period) that Froese was the prime creative force in the group.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/td/oedipus_tyrannus.jpg" width="300" alt="Oedipus Tyrannus album cover" title="Oedipus Tyrannus album cover" /></p>

<p>Finally, there’s <a href="https://voices-in-the-net.de/oedipus_tyrannus.htm">a lost Tangerine Dream album</a>: in 1974 Tangerine Dream recorded music for a performance of Oedipus Rex at the Chichester Festival. The 70 minute suite was originally intended for as an album release, but was eventually shelved. Some parts got circulated in bootleg format, but Oedpius Tyrannus didn’t get a full release until 2019.</p>

<p>Oedipus Tyrannus is absolutely fascinating. The first track, Overture, contains elements hearkening back to Zeit, while “Act 1” and “Act 2: Battle” are more reminiscent of Phaedra. “Act2: Baroque” simultaneously hints forward to Stratosfear and back Atem. “Act 2: Zeus” is a throwback to Zeit again. The beginning of “Act 3” was used for the conclusion of Rubycon part 2, and later there’s some furious sequencer clatter (with resonant squelch reminiscent of acid house!).</p>

<p>So what to make of all that? As background misery for a Greek tragedy the music makes perfect sense, and there are plenty of great moments, but it just doesn’t quite gel as an album.</p>

<p>With all that said, Oedipus Tyrannus remains intriguing for being a stylistic compendium Tangerine Dream’s work to that point, without having a distinct identity of its own. Despite that it’s still good to have it.</p>

<h1 id="what-do-i-get-out-of-tangerine-dream">What do I get out of Tangerine Dream?</h1>

<p>This is a personal outline of why Tangerine Dream means so much to me. I should say at the outset that is my subjective viewpoint, and I don’t even expect hardcore Tangerine Dream fans to necessarily agree with me.</p>

<p>For me classic Tangerine Dream is the intersection of the following phenomena:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sonic open-mindedness steeped in 1960s German avant-garde</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelia">Psychedelia</a></li>
  <li>A strong desire to explore <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublime_(philosophy)">the sublime</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Point 1 we’ve already discussed. Point 2. is almost too obvious to mention, but I will point out that while I’ve never used psychedelics and wouldn’t dare presume to understand what it’s like to consume them, I do get a sense that Tangerine Dream’s classic era music is the result of some profound <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychonautics">psychonautical experiences</a>.</p>

<p>As for point 3, there are moments in Tangerine Dream’s music where it evokes both grandeur and horror, which lines up well with the Romantic conception of the Sublime.</p>

<p>Tangerine Dream’s music is rooted in traditional Western tonality, although in the Classic albums there’s usually some element of discord present that hints at psychological extremes. Perhaps that’s why it appealed to me as a teenager. Even when the music is more quiet or serene, there’s always an undercurrent of drama (indeed literally so with Oedipus Tyrannus).</p>

<p>The drama and earnestness of classic Tangerine Dream has perhaps made them less hip (if more hippie) than the other two great Krautrock bands, Kraftwerk and Can. And I should say though that the classic albums are not without fault. Some of the bloops and bleeps are now dated and quaint. Zeit clearly has some debts to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Ligeti">Ligeti</a> (and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(soundtrack)#Music">Kubrick</a>, for that matter). And there’s the lingering Pink Floyd influence…</p>

<p>Even so, classic Tangerine Dream remains for me a companion for life. Much of that is perhaps tied to being 17 when I first heard them, but I feel the singular feature of the band is that they meant every note of what they did. I can’t know precisely what Tangerine Dream were really about, but I’ve always found their early vision utterly compelling.</p>

<p>I’ve spoken about religious devotion to Tangerine Dream, and that’s a bit of exaggeration for comic effect, but they are a group a take more seriously than any other. This may be an odd way to end up, but that’s where I am.</p>
