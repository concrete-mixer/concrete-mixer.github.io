# Introduction

While viewing JoJo's Bizarre Adventure MMD videos I stumbled across some JoJo dancings choreographed to songs by a group called [K/DA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K/DA). The music was sufficiently impressive that I decided to watch the original videos, discovering that K/DA is an animated "girl" group comprised of characters from a video game called [League of Legends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends). I then watched [a useful explainer about the group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de-xgNEsE3I) and learned that K/DA's western producers intentionally wrote the songs to emulate the K-pop genre. This essay is a personal (which is to say idiosyncratic and unreliable) exploration of K/DA and my experience of K-pop.


# K-pop and its part in my downfall

Because K/DA is K-pop-oriented, it makes sense to examine K-pop first. Well, Wikipedia can give you a more [sensible explanation of K-pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-pop) than I ever could, so instead I'll yammer on about how I got into it.

Going waaay back in time to the late 2000s, my wife and I began watching K dramas. (We'd watched lots of HK dramas, and a J and T drama or two, so it's not as random as it might seem.) K-dramas proved to be a gateway drug to K variety shows, specifically [Running Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_Man_(South_Korean_TV_series)), which was very popular across asia in the early 2010s. Running Man frequently featured K-pop singers, but while we did take some interest K-pop singers who had both been in dramas *and* appeared on Running Man, it wasn't until that epoch-defining revelation of PSY's [Gangnam Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangnam_Style) in 2012 that I began listening in earnest.

(Look, I'll readily concede that now ten years have passed, I might have gotten a bit too into that curious phenomenon. But you know, you had to be there, man.)

After some explanatory listening, I found I was more interested in the girl groups. The reason for this is that while the boy groups seemed stuck permanently in 1988 making [New Jack Swing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_jack_swing) singles (one exception: Big Bang), the girl groups tended to have more angst and silliness in their music. I think this is because while all K pop tends to a female (or gay) audience, boy and girl groups have different functions. Boy idols are there to be unthreatening (if also unattainable) love interests, while girl idols are friends to admire for their poise and skill and/or relatable feelings.

Is this characterisation too simplistic? Probably, but I suspect it's a reasonable percentage of the truth.

In 2012 the biggest girl group was [SNSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girls%27_Generation), but I preferred more eccentric groups like [Orange Caramel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Caramel), and (later) [Crayon Pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crayon_Pop); or the more EDMish outfits like [f(x)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F(x)_(musical_group)) and [2NE1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2NE1).

I kept an eye on the K-pop scene for a few years, but around 2016 I began to lose interest in all K phenomena. With K dramas I'd seen as many variations on "downtrodden but plucky female implausibly pursued by multiple [chaebol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaebol) heir suitors" as I could tolerate. With K variety, after a few hundred episodes of Running man the formula got pretty stale for me - as I think it would for most people after that long. As for K-pop, the music was also beginning to feel a bit samey (and this is still true for me more than half a decade later). I was also put off by the petty (and [not so petty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Sun_scandal) scandals continually bubbling up (I used to think Korean "netizens" were the most judgemental people on Earth, until Facebook and Twitter deranged the brains of Westerners). But I was most demoralised by the steady rate of K-pop suicides, esp Goo Hara of Kara and Sulli of f(x). I began to feel complicit in the harm K-pop caused its performers, and I stopped listening.

Until last year. My K pop curiosity was reignited when I learned that boy group [BTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTS) had topped the Billboard charts in the US. In the mid 2010s I thought a girl group might have a chance of doing this, at some point, but never a boy group (even one with [their own army](https://www.usbtsarmy.com/)). Curiouser still, the number one hit song in question, [Dynamite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdZLi9oWNZg), was the same old New Jack Swing. Weird! That said, the BTS chaps seem nice - [at least when they interact with robots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJZeMgqQMjA) - and I wish them well.

But since I'd taken the trouble to investigate BTS, I thought I might as well learn more about [Blackpink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpink), the pre-eminent K-pop girl group who had debuted and risen to the top while I was off the K-pop bandwagon.

Blackpink are successors to YG Entertainment's 2NE1, who unceremoniously expired when one of their members experienced a rather minor drug scandal back in 2015. Blackpink have largely continued where 2NE1 left off. The group is comprised of mostly-singers Ji Soo and Rose, and mostly-rappers Jennie and Lisa. Like many K-pop groups, Blackpink's composition is cosmopolitan in outlook: Lisa is Thai, while Jennie spent her formative years in New Zealand and Rose was raised in Australia.

Over the past six years Blackpink have assembled numerous shock-and-awe singles. My favourites are Ddu-du Ddu-du (see below), [How You Like that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioNng23DkIM), and [Whistle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dISNgvVpWlo).

The songs tend to start out with petulant rapping by Jennie and Lisa, before modulating to  angsty singing by Ji Soo and Rose, and then onto the chorus. I confess I tend to spend the singing bits waiting for the next rap segment, but the songs are usually well-constructed, and there are numerous excursions into unexpected territory that have me going "whaaat!?" - in a good way. Basically they're a riot.

And then we come to the videos. YG has produced some glitzy stuff in the past ([take that!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAbokV76tkU), [and that!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7_lSP8Vc3o)), but those vids seem minimalist in comparison to the almost baroque production value of recent Blackpink outings. Ddu-du Ddu-du has some particularly eye-poppingly odd moments.

During my investigations I discovered that Blackpink had a [Netflix doco](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81106901?trackId=255824129) - unthinkable for a US-based media company to be producing a few years ago, but all too predictable now. "Blackpink: Light up the Sky" is a reasonably frank portrayal of life under the K-pop regime. (To give you a very brief idea of how the system works, aspiring adolescent K-Poppers are scouted - usually in shopping malls - by a management agency, and then auditioned. Those who make the grade live in an agency dormitory for several years, being trained around the clock. Wages are slim, and chances of unceremonious disposal are high. Gradually the promising coalesce into prospective groups, until finally the tight-knit, loyal, battle-hardened and success-hungry Chosen are anointed. Whatever else you might think about it - and I think quite a lot about it, actually - it's a practice that gets results.)

I was suspicious that the doco was purely propaganda, and I imagine there was much that was glossed over, but I got the impression the group were able to recount their struggles with genuine candour. We may not have gotten the whole story, but if you aspired to K-pop glory you wouldn't watch "Light up the Sky" and conclude that it's all sweetness and light.

Here's an aside: watching the doco, it occurred to me that Blackpink's training must have occurred during 2NE1's final years. Were 2NE1 aware that YG's trainees would eventually succeed them? How could they not? For if not these partictrainees, then eventually others would... It's a tough business.

If being a K-pop trainee seems harsh, it's nothing compared to being successful: 18 hour days, endless appearances at fan meets, lengthy video shoots, and trying to seem interesting but also down to earth in highly-scripted media appearences.

But wait, there's more! Long international tours, the constant fear of physical attacks by obsessive fans or fending off sexual "attention" from sleazy "entertainment figures", and the stress of attaining and retaining lucrative product endorsements. Your words and actions need to justify the loyalty of your fans, your family, your bandmates, your country, and those you work with in your agency. There's constant risk of ground down by excessive online opprobrium. Having a personal life is extremely difficult; a love life is forbidden - you must remain in mint condition for the duration of your youth.

With all that going on you can see why mental health crises, drug scandals, and suicides are quite common in the K-pop world.

So far Blackpink seem to have survived, but there will inevitably be a point when they will drift from being "it" to becoming "was". In the doco the group's members seemed to think that all the sacrifices have been worth it; I hope that's true and continues to so. They can take comfort in knowing that at this point it's going to be a hell of a group that surpasses them.

## Hang on

So I've spent a lot of time cataloguing some of the participants and many of the crimes of K-pop, but I should point out that manufactured pop groups, and indeed every popular musical combo at any time and place, has been subject to some level of exploitation. The difference, I would argue, is that western kids are less likely to put up with K-pop-style regimentation, and so aren't subjected to those excesses, whereas the communal conformity of Korean culture tends to increase the likelihood of everybody going along with things until harm happens.

Actually, I'd *like* to thing that Western kids would be less susceptible, but I'm not sure they that's actually true. Hmmm.

# K/DA

Now we've got a sense of the high-stakes tension of a real K-pop group, let us decompress somewhat and consider a virtual one. I vaguely heard of K/DA when they debuted in 2018, but this was during my "over it" K-pop dark age, and I could't be bothered investigating. But in late 2021, thanks to a tenuous JJBA connection, I was now in a place to give it a whirl.

So K/DA is a virtual girl group featuring four characters from the online game League of Legends characters. The group's music is produced in house by League of Legends publisher [Riot Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_Games). I've never played League of Legends and have no idea who the group's "members" actually are. I could spend two minutes looking them up, but I think it would be more humorous to simply characterise them as follows:

- the gritty, urban one
- the cocktail bar singer
- [Sporty Spice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanie_C)
- [Foxy Lady](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumiho)


To underscore how out of depth I am in analysing K/DA, I should point out that my prior reference points for music made by animated entities are the following:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h9nE2spOw_o" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Wish me luck!

The first K/DA single was a song called Pop/Stars. Here's the video:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UOxkGD8qRB4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The song features Korean and American singers, who all do an excellent job. The musical style broadly conforms to the EDM end of K-pop, plausibly like something from YG producer [Teddy Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_Park), the production powerhouse behind Blackpink's work.  It's hard to quantify, but Pop/Stars feels a touch more westernised to me, but there's enough K for the experience not to feel ersatz.

While musically the song's well-constructed, and the production is immaculate, there's not much going on lyrically - unless you're a connoisseur of bog-standard hiphop "I'm much better than you" braggadocio. But since pop music isn't supposed to be Milton, I'll give it a pass. All up then, I reckon Pop/stars is manufactured pop _par excellence_, and the [hundreds of millions of Spotify plays](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4gOc8TsQed9eqnqJct2c5v) and YouTube views suggests it has been very successful.

What of the video? Well, for me it's a bravura display of motion, colour, and secondary sex characteristics. (Let me wag my finger at the vid's appeal to the [male gaze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_gaze), though. Boo!) It doesn't put a foot wrong.


One final thing to mention: Pop/stars was performed in a [bizarre ritual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9oDlvOV3qs) at the opening ceremony of the 2018 League of Legends world champs (presented by Mastercard!), held in (appropriately) Incheon, South Korea. The real singers of the song were present, accompanied virtually by their K/DA avatars. If I've got this correct, the virtual members could only be viewed by spectators via an augmented reality app on their smartphones. I have complex feelings about whether this is pioneering or silly, but I will say that if I'd tried to explain the scenario to my late grandfather, he'd have given me a look like I was a fucking idiot.

## "More"

In 2020 K/DA released a second single, "More", which is indeed more of the same:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3VTkBuxU4yk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Musically I thin More has an edge over Pop/Stars, but the video is greatly inferior. The character design is more 3 dimensional look, but only serves to send the viewer tumbling into the [uncanny valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley), and the result is vaguely repellant. Again there's not much going on lyrically. So it's a bit of a mixed bag. Great to listen to, less enjoyable to watch.

In my JoJo survey I jokingly suggested some MMD videos of JJBA characters dancing to More were superior to the original. That's a bit unfair, but I will say this video of [JoJo villains replicating More's antics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l1MBNgXLr4) is pleasingly silly.

2020 also saw K/DA release [All Out](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4gOc8TsQed9eqnqJct2c5v/discography/all?uri=spotify:album:26IdRjba8f8DNa7c0FwfQb) an EP which featured More plus four other songs. You'd expect the non-single songs to be filler, but they're actually pretty decent. And all up I find myself hoping that K/DA will release, well, _more_ material in future.

# Conclusion

Compared with the K-pop mill, K/DA feels comparatively less exploitative, in that the human vocalists are basically session performers, so outside of recording sessions (and at least one League of Legends stadium appearence), they're free to live their lives as they want. K/DA may be an overly refined, nutrition-free corporate product, but it's one I can enjoy without feeling guilty about it. As for genuine K-pop groups, bless them all! I hope you make it out alive.
