title: New Age music
---

What is New Age music? Well, I a bit like pornography, it's hard to define, but I know it when I hear it. As a rule I don't like it because I think it's superficial and trite. But for all that I've discovered quite a few decent New Age albums, ones that cleave to (at least some) New Age genre conventions, but are written with enough nous to transcend the limitations of the style.

I find these "good" New Age albums so fascinating that I thought I'd do a survey of them, to see what we shall see...

# "Good" New Age albums

## The Harmonic Choir - Hearing Solar Winds (1982)

<img src="/assets/new-age/hearing-solar-winds.jpg" width="300" alt="Hearing Solar Winds album cover" title="Hearing Solar Winds">

I first heard throat singing on KLF's Chill Out. The KLF-loving members of my social circle assumed the effect was a resonant filter put on the singer's voice, so finding out later that humans could actually make those sounds was pretty astonishing.

But it turns out that in the mid 1970s an American named David Hykes had assembled the Harmonic Choir, a ragtag group of overtonal singers.

Hearing Solar Winds was recorded in a French Church over several nights in 1983. It's just voices and reverb and the occasional tinging Asiatic chime (which I find unnecessary, but may have felt crucial for the singers, so I'm not going to condemn it outright).

Proceedings commence with Rainbow Voice, which is a single overtoned voice. The singing is minimal, focuses on harmonic generation. It reminds me of the numerous hours I've spent playing with a monophonic synth generating bass tones, sweeping the low-pass filter cutoff and enjoying the hearing harmonic tweak into existence, resonate, and fade back. Is it a spiritual experience? I'm not sure, but if you absolutely have to label an experience like that spiritual, I guess I would allow it. While I gradually learned (if not wholly) that filter-swept drones are pretty old-hat, if you're a human who can do it, you should go for it. Here the singer (Hykes perhaps) goes for gold, and gets there.

"Multiplying Voices At the Heart of the Body of Sound" (not an early Tangerine Dream track title, but is indistinguishable from one), as the title suggests, introduces multiple voices, singing the same tone but slightly detuned to create beats. The harmonic ambiguity is of this is great. Eventually the voices resolve into chords, and it's not sappy, it feels kind of right.

Arc Descents - again as the title suggests, features voices slowly descending, falling out of and into tune gracefully.

The strangely modernly-titled Gravity Waves is a 2001ish soundscape of gradually evolving harmonies.

The longest track is Telescoping, where the voices ranging through one another in a slowly changing, hypnotic way.

On Ascending and Descending the voices range up and down in a way similar to the opener Rainbow Voice. It's slightly reminiscent of the Popul Vuh track that opens Herzog's Nosferatu. Then the sound fades away.

What makes this album so good? I think part of the key is that it's powered solely by the human voice, which makes it timeless. The voices are suspended in space too, and the church's reverb kind leaves them floating in eternity. The motivations of the choir are New Age and the sound is warm and positive, yet none of these elements are in any way a detriment.

The album that most reminds me of Hearing Solar Winds is Tangerine Dream's Zeit, and not just for the track names: both albums are long, and largely structureless. It's worth comparing the albums too to highlight my New Age/Ambient divide (I wouldn't really call Zeit Ambient - it's too serious - but it's more on that side of the spectrum). Whereas Zeit's objective is to explore the subject of time on its own terms (ie without reference to Eastern spiritual practice), with whatever sounds they can, Hykes comes to proceedings with the healing power of an Eastern overtonal singing circle. This makes the difference for me: Zeit is an unconstrainedly Great Album, whereas Hearing Solar Winds is merely a Great New Age album.

I'll concede it's an imprecise comparison, and assumes that there's something wrong with Eastern Spiritual practice. It's not that I think that Eastern spirituality is bunk, exactly, but I think it's a well best dipped from sparingly, not something to build your whole being around.

All that aside (and I feel bad for having said it), Hearing Solar Winds has helped me to slumber on many a night, and I unreservedly salute Hykes for his genius.

## Steve Hillage - Rainbow Dome Musick (1979)

<img src="/assets/new-age/rainbow-dome-musick.jpg" width="300" alt="Rainbow Dome Musick album cover" title="Rainbow Dome Musick">

Former Gong member Steve Hillage, with and wife/partner Miquette Giraudy were previously in the prog-hippie band Gong. Hillage and Giraudy provided some of the more contemplative electronic moments in Gong's music (when they weren't banging on about bloody pothead pixies).

Rainbow Dome Musick was "Recorded for the Rainbow Dome at the Festival for Mind-Body-Spirit Olympia London April 21-29. 1979.", which should give you an idea. Things start with the sound of water trickling into a pool, which, on playing back just now encouraged my wife to use the bathroom. Other this sound and electric piano and synth waft in gently and lovingly. Gradually a spiraling sequencer comes in to play. Things waft about celestially, with Hillage's guitar making an appearance.

Four Ever Rainbow starts with a ting sound sound and some raspy bass monosynth harmonic twiddling. There's some catlike sines and a plinky heavy delayed synth. It's very New Age, but more shockingly, it sounds like the Orb, and this is not a coincidence: Rainbow Dome Musick was a disc spun by the Orb's LX Paterson and the KLF's Jimmy Cauty when they (re)discovered ambient in the late 80s. Indeed, Hillage and Giraudy collaborated with the Orb on the wonderful Orb track Blue Room. All of this suggests the boundary between ambient and New Age is more porous.

## Inter-dimensional music - Iasos (1975)

<img src="/assets/new-age/interdimensional-music.jpg" width="300" alt="Inter-dimensional Music album cover" title="Inter-dimensional Music">

[Iasos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iasos_(musician)) is an American-Greek New Ager, and this album from the mid 1970s feels much later than that, because it contains many New Age/ambient tropes. The music is clear and peaceful without being cloying, and there's a fresh, bright openness to the music. The arrangement is reasonably jazzy, with flute, guitar, and piano, garnished with synth washes and plenty of space in the arrangements. It's a musical document that's both utterly infused by the New Age, but not dogmatically bound to it. To me the standout track is Rainbow Canyon, which has a Gongish, Krautrocky vibe. Lots of shimmering slide or pedal-steel guitar.

## Ashra - Blackouts (1977)

<img src="/assets/new-age/blackouts.jpg" width="300" alt="Blackouts album cover" title="Blackouts">

Ashra started life as the Krautrock band Ashra Tempel, who produced some remarkable albums in the early 1970s (including a collaboration with Timothy Leary?!). By 1977 the group's creative powerhouses Klaus Schulze and Manuel Gottsching had gone their own ways; Schulze had embarked on a successful solo career as a synth guru (curiously, despite his music being essentially My Thing, I've never been moved by it), while Gottsching rebranded as Ashra, a banner for his solo work. The title of the first Ashra album, New Age of Earth (1976), gives a clear indication of Gottsching's intentions, but the followup album Blackouts is the one I wish to include in my "good" New Age list.

The first track, "77 Slightly Delayed", is a genial piece, synth-propelled and with interest maintained by Garcia-esque guitar. (This track is in the "style" known as Berlin School, which basically boils down to a synth sequence plus a human-played solo. Initially pioneered by Tangerine Dream with their first sequencer-driven track Phaedra, the Berlin-residing artists Edgar Froese, Klaus Schulze, and Manuel Gottsching elaborated on the style through the 70s - Froese mostly on his solo albums, while Schulze and Gottsching made it their primary modus operandi. Schulze's Berlin School sound is (to my mind) anaemic and dull, but Gottsching gave it a bit more variation and texture (esp on what's arguably his best album, [E2-E4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E2-E4) from 1981).

Track 2, Midnight on Mars, is a gentle space jazz outing. Don't Trust The Kids, sounds more like Air than anything else? The track is attached to its followup, Blackouts, which erupts in a blaze of guitar solo.Shuttlecock is a geometric spiral of multiple guitars and afro rhythms. Concluding the album is the more straightforwardly New Agey Lotus Part I - IV, which shuffles around reasonably cheerfully, although some dissonance is allowed in at one point.

To be honest, New Age of Earth is more straightforwardly New Age than Blackouts, but because of that it's less interesting. Is it New Age enough? Well, if you compare it to the primordial fire of Ash Ra Tempel's first album, it is, yes. If you compare it to something [Hearts of Spacey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts_of_Space_Records), not so much. Interestingly, the Ashra album following BLackouts, Correlations (1979), was a more rock(!) affair, so it's almost like over the course of three albums Gottsching recanted his New Age swerve.

Blackouts then, represents an imperfect example of Krautrock trend of evolving from experimental rock to a much softer, more appealing and largely New Age sound. Tangerine Dream, Michael Rother, Popul Vuh (earlier than most), and Cluster (on increasingly New Age label Sky Records!) all went there. Those that didn't largely faded into obscurity. Or were Kraftwerk. It was a strangely weak end to arguably the most fertile art music movement in the late 20th Century. On the other hand, if it paid for mortgages, you know, good on it.

## Tony Scott - Music for Zen Meditation and Other Joys (1964)

<img src="/assets/new-age/music-for-zen-meditation.jpg" width="300" alt="Music for Zen Meditation album cover" title="Music for Zen Meditation">

Tony Scott was primarily a jazz clarinetist, but was interested in music from other cultures, and produced an album sufficiently early to be considered the first New Age album; you could make a case for it being a seminal ambient or World music album too. Hell, let's add fusion to the list too.

The arrangement is very minimal: Scott & clarinet, plus koto and shakuhachi. At first the music sounds like standard minor key Japanese folk music, but Scott's clarinet puts in enough bend to the notes that you realise you're listening to something deliberately other. Basically what I'm saying is that Scott isn't merely - and I'm putting this perhaps too crudely - "going native", he's contributing his own ideas to the Japanese music.

And there's another joy to the album: being the first album of World or New Age music, it's completely unselfconscious. Clearly, purely New Age, without any of the bullshit that the genre later accreted.

My only criticism of the album, and it's a criticism of underlying mode of Japanese folk music generally: the minimal arrangement, the meditative mood, and the traditional scale used make the tracks pretty samey. Maybe that's the whole point, though: transporting the listener's mind to the same place, every time.

## Michael Stearns - Planetary Unfolding (1981)

<img src="/assets/new-age/planetary-unfolding.jpg" width="300" alt="Planetary Unfolding album cover" title="Planetary Unfolding">

Michael Stearns' biggest claim to fame is that he scored the early 90s "non-narrative" documentary film Baraka. His career a long way before that, however, and Planetary Unfolding is a remarkable document from the early 80s. The first track, "In the Beginning", unfurls inexorably from a quiet bass drone into a transcendent crescendo that I would have to say is the most transcendiest and cresciendiest I've heard.

The rest of the album proceeds with much the same majesty. The only duff track is Life in the Gravity Well, but even then because it contains a wailing chanteuse part that isn't to my taste. Now I'm not against wailing in itself: there's a similar example in the KLF's Chill Out, and I am completely in awe of Ofra Haza. I think does work. It's the particular _style_ of this wailing: it's a New Age, swims-with-dolphins and births-underwater kind of a wail. Not to my taste, anyway.

The final track, Something's Moving, starts with a tickyticky sound that is quite odd for a concluding track, but it music eventually resolves with a wonderful sense of completion.

On the face of it there's not much about Plantary Unfolding is definitively New Age; it could be considered space rock, or ambient. What gives it away is the music's unashamed embrace of grandeur. Eno wouldn't do that; Tangerine Dream would but they'd make it cold and alien. Stearns' evokes a sublime that isn't hostile, and I think it's that earnestness that makes the music New Age. Perhaps also crucial to the album's winning quality is the use of early 80s analog-synthesis-in-its-prime synths, rather than mid 80s digital synths, which could be a bit brittle and tinny.

A further revelation is that the album as a whole (not just the wail) reminds me of my favourite ambient album, the KLF's ambient classic Chill Out. This could be put down to the superficial similarity of the synthetic arrangements, but I suspect that somewhere deep down there is a kindred spirit between Rockman, King Boy, and New Age practitioners like Stearns. (Come to think of it, I've just remembered the KLF's obsession with Ley Lines. There's a bit of New Age even in pop's most piss-taking pranksters.)

## James Holden - The Animal Spirits (2017)

<img src="/assets/new-age/the-animal-spirits.jpg" width="300" alt="The Animal Spirits album cover" title="The Animal Spirits">

James Holden has a storied pedigree as a DJ and remixer with a sideline producing wonky electronica using modular synth(s?). Holden's album The Animal Spirits was recorded with a band. The result sometimes sounds a bit like Terry Riley, and sometimes it recalls a 1970s psychedelia-infused tribal jazz. The result is really great, and really rather New Age.

Without knowing more about motivations of Holden and his cadre, I can't say if The Animal Spirits was intended to be New Age, but I detect a strong sense of English paganism in the music. It's not necessarily a paganism from the past; it could equally be a paganism of a post-civilisation come-down. Chalk horses. Even if the intent and effect is of a very different trajectory to Californian hippies'n'buddhism'n'crystals New Age, I still think The Animal Spirits are decidedly kindred.

# Conclusions

What can we conclude from this survey? I don't seem to have any insightful final thoughts other than: sufficiently good music will always transcend the dross of its genre. I still have an instinctive suspicion of New Age music because I think much (though not necessarily all) the underlying thinking behind the New Age movement is humbug. But these albums have taught me to - sometimes at least - be less quick to judge.
