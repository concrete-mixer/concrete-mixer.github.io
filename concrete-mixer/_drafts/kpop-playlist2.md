This is a ramble through a bunch of K-pop songs that I like. My involvement with K-pop has been pretty arbitrary. I got into because of Gangnam Style, but I wouldn't have paid any attention had the video not featured Yoo Jae-suk from Running Man, a K variety show Sally and I used to watch. As it is, I feel Gangnam Style is one of humanity's greatest achievements.

I tend to prefer girl groups to boy groups, because girl groups tend to have more songs that I like (dramatic, angsty, eccentric), whereas boy groups are there more to be non-threatening, so their music tends to be bland.

I will say there's a very specific type of K-pop song I like, and which is relatively rare: highly wrought dance tracks. Anything folky or cutesy I'm not interested in, to the point that I find it difficult to systematically listen to K-pop because I'm largely listening to music I really don't care for. Because of this, I can't claim this list is exhaustive. For all I know there are dozens of similar songs I've just never heard.
What else should you know before I start? Well, there are two major Kpop stables: SM and YG. I'll be referring to these a lot.

Right, with all that out of the way, here's my list.

# Girls' Generation

Nine piece Girls Generation was SM Entertainment's flagship group for many years. Their signature early songs "Into the New World", "Gee", "Genie", and "Oh!" are "classics that defined an era", etc, but a bit too cutesy for my liking. 

## Flower Power (2012)

Apart from Gangnam Style, this song did the most to turn me on to K-pop. It's actually a Japanese-language single from arguably the biggest group of the time, the nine member Girls' GeneratioThis track has a juggernaut beat, inscrutable lyrics, and fair thunders along.

### Awkward bit

Well, the chorus does sound like "Butterfly pooped a spider".

## Mr Taxi (2011)

Another Japanese single. Not exactly in my fave zone stylistically, I chiefly include it because it's just so gosh-darn catchy.

# 2NE1 - I am the Best (2011)

This is perhaps the apotheosis of the YG sound. An absolute banger!

# Big Bang - Fantastic Baby (2012)

Sort of a companion to I am the Best, this is my sole boy group entry on the list. But what an adventure!

## Awkward bit

I think the boom-shakalakas at the end are ill-advised.

# G-Dragon - One of a kind

This item from Big Bang's chief rapper has a low key, spacious sound.

# f(x)

This SM entertainment unit best epitomised the sound that I'm interested in, at least in the early 2010s.

## NU ABO (2010)

"Na na na na-na na-na na na-na-na-na na na na naa na na na." Feautres a bi

## Electric (2010)
