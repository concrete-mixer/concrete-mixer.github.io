title: Maxima through minima

I was introduced to Boards of Canada in 1998 by my friend Michael (who has introduced me to many of the things I write about). He lent me the group's first LP, the then-recently-released Music Has the Right to Children. On first listen I took an immediate dislike to what I heard. Large swathes of the album were given over to listless hiphop instrumentals, which I found dreary. Other tracks were given over to syrupy synths. More than this I disliked how the music was navel-gazing and backward-looking. Given I'm prone to both these traits that might seem a bit rich, but at that time I liked my contemporary electronica shiny and forward looking. Music Has the Right to Children, a bit like Air's Moon Safari, which came out the same year, was finding inspiration in the past.

These days, all we really have is the past, or perhaps an eternal present, where all styles and options are continuously with us, giving no sense of change. It used to be something that bothered me a lot, but eventually my irritation began to annoy me more than the phenomenon I was irritated at, and in that way I got over it.

While I was having nothing to do with the brothers Sandison in 1998, Boards of Canada became a powerful force in electronica, and three years later, in a more conciliatory mood, I listened to the album again. This time I found a handful of songs - Roygbiv, Aquarius, Olson - to be pretty good. I was still a bit leery of it, though; and conflicted about it.

But Boards of Canada has a way of seeping into you. In 2002 my grandfather died and on the day of his funeral I had the bittersweet tune Olson stuck in my head. It wasn't the sort of thing to really associate with Granddad at all (he would have preferred a bit of Vaughn Williams), but it stuck with me. The trap was starting to close...

A few months later I heard some music in a cafe and was intrigued enough to I ask what it was. "The new Boards of Canada album," was the reply. When I eventually got my hands on this new record, Geogaddi I found that while again there were a handleful of tracks that had the right mood for me (my favourite is The Beach at Red Point), mostly the album was bit overly long and turgid, though I'll grant that an interlude featuring Leslie Neilsen is pretty funny. Overall though, my relationship with Boards of Canada was still at an impasse.

The years tumbled on. In 2005 The Campfire Head Phase came out, and I didn't _really_ like this one at all. The only one I can remember offhand is Dayvan Cowboy, which was way too sappy and raucous for my liking. To date there's no tracks on that disc that I particularly enjoy.

By the late 2000s I'd given BoC a fair go, but in truth I liked five tracks from three albums, and that's a pretty meagre return. And yet, those five tracks were pretty compelling (more on this later). What finally tipped me from being a conflicted appreciator to genuine fan was discovering, on my then-employer's highly dubious music server I discovered a BoC collection called Maxima. It was a casette demo from the mid 90s, immortalised in mp3 form. The collection featured tracks that would (mostly) feature "officially" on later EPs and Music has the Right to Children.

What's odd about Maxima is that although it features many of the same listless, dull tracks from MHTRTC, somehow the sequencing works more to their benefit. It helps too that there are a few tracks with more momentum (such as Niagara and Red Moss) which help things along. All up, after a decade of vacillation, Maxima made me into a genuine BoC fan. I wonder if all that I needed was a cohesive long player to latch on to (I've always been more into albums that singles).

It's perhaps interesting to note that BoC is the only act with whom I've had such a tortured journey before liking.

At the same time I also discovered the 2000 EP A Beautiful Place in the Country, which I enjoyed, and revisiting MHTRTC, for the first time I appreciated Eagle in Your Mind, Telephasic Workshop, and Pete Standing Alone. At last I could get thorugh MHTRTC without skipping tracks. Geogaddi and Campfire Headphase remain impenetrable to me though.

2009 through 2012 was the peak of my obsession with Boards of Canada. Obviously I had an in-built appreciation of the group's 70s sound, but I came to increasingly associate BoC with memories of my own early childhood. I've read of other fans experiencing this same phenomenon, with BoC recalling their often miserable 70s and 80s childhoods. Mine was pretty benign, but BoC more brought to mind experiences of scratched and worn educational media on film reels or cassettes. BoC transported me to playing in playgrounds made of left over reinforced concrete stormwater piping, or block painting with wedges of potato. BoC's use of National Film Board of Canada and PBS films in their tracks obviously helped with the transportation (there was a lot of "quality" North American and UK series on telly way back when, a far cry from the high-fructose content of children's entertainment in recent decades). The Sandison brothers are four years older than me, and it seems this relatively small age gap means I "get" their points of reference.

I think going into my mid thirties my own childhood was becoming remote and mysterious, too. It's perhaps not coincidental that during this period I was also into the media-analysis/comedy of Charlie Brooker, who is the same age as the Sandersons, and has a similar preoccupation with the 1970s and 80s.

It's tempting to wonder if there's something about Gen X or the 70s and 80s that's susceptible to this sort of nostalgia. I guess retro artefacts like Sha Na Na or (if you want to go back a touch further) Wordsworth's "Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood" suggest otherwise. My viewpoint on this is so biased I really don't feel qualified to argue for it too hard, but it's easy to make up a narrative of the Sandisons tapping into a last hurrah of analogue media before our culture became consumed by the eternal digital now.

Although I was into BoC heavily at the time, I didn't catch up with the group's 2013 album, Tomorrow's Harvest, until three years later. Their infrequent release schedule had conditioned me not to expect anything new, and I'm insufficiently interested in new music to keep tabs on what's happening generally. The album was worth the wait though; I think Tomorrow's Harvest is BoC's bleak, miserable masterpiece.

I knew the album owed much to dystopian SF soundtracks, but I didn't understand just how much until I watched George A. Romero's Day of the Dead (1985) and heard a music cue that made me think (putting the horse before the cart), "that sounds like Boards of Canada".

The group hasn't put out any new music for a decade now and you have to wonder how the Sandison brothers feed themselves. Four albums in 25 years shows admirable restraint, I suppose. But if you don't release new music or perform, do you really exist at all? (Could it be the brothers actually have day jobs working in the planning department of some Scottish town council?) If they are working full time on BoC, it would seem their productivity is absolutely feeble. No touring, very infrequent releases... It's not as if their tracks are very complex, even if the sound is very precise.

Looking at it another way, it's possible they've already said all want to say, but if they want to release more, I'd be interested in hearing it.

The BoC spell on me has worn off somewhat in recent years. The cause? Well, my son has reached the age I was when I developed the memories that I now associate with BoC. Watching the world through his eyes, I sense he'll find this time in his life intriguing as well.
