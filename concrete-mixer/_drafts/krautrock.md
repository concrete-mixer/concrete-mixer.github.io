Welcome to my idiosyncratic survey of Krautrock, the German experimental rock movement that flourished from the late 1960s to the late 1970s. I've already written about one of its chief pillars, Tangerine Dream, but there's a lot of other wonderful groups to explore.

# What is

If you want to know what Krautrock is, you'd best start with:

- the BBC's [Krautrock: the Rebirth of Germany](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP5dOKTB3ng).
- the mercurial Julian Cope's Krautrock top 50 albums list. His is something of a superset of what I like (I'm not much fond of the more conventional psych rock of bands like the Cosmic Jokers, Amon Duul II, and Guru Guru), but it's pretty decent.
- And you probably won't go (too) wrong if you consult Wikipedia's Krautrock entry.

# Kraftwerk

There's not much to say about Kraftwerk that hasn't already been said, but my personal faves are Radio-Activity (1975), and Ralf und Florian (1973). They are an absolutely extraordinary outfit, a sort of electronic Beatles, in a way (I'm sure I'm not the first to make that comparison). Random notes:

- the first two albums are highly experimental, and also (the odd gem aside) pretty shit. If you compare Kraftwek II (1971) and Computerworld (1981) years later, you'd scarcely credit it's the same band.
- I think Computerworld is their apotheosis, although, as pretty much the first Techno album, it's arguably outside the realm of Krautrock altogether (Cope discounts any album after Autobahn as being Krautrock).
- I love early Kraftwerk flute & piano tunes like Heimatlange and Morgenspaziergang. Ananassymphonie is also brilliant. Bit of a shame the group won't relrelease them properly. Hopefully one day that will change, assuming the master tapes still exist...
- I prefer the first side of Trans Europe Express (I actually find the title track a bit dull, so side 2 is a complete bust for me).
- I love that despite the near-reality of rhythm automation in the 1970s, Kraftwerk used live drums (with even the odd, very human error creeping into recordings). Man-machine indeed.
- With the house-music retooling of the Mix album and tour in 1990, Kraftwerk kind of pioneered the whole heritage act thing.
- Tour de France Soundtracks (2003) is both a dream come true (new Kraftwerk album!) and a deep disappointment (enough with the cycling already!)

# Can

I think of Kraftwerk, Can, and Tangerine Dream as the Krautrock Big Three. (I suspect most afficianados would rate Tangerine Dream at a distant third, but I strongly agree.) What I like about the three groups is that they have utterly different characters. Can is the most conventionally "rock" in arrangement, but also made highly idiosyncratic music, and had a stunningly impressive lineup of freaks and weirdos. My favourite album? Well, I would say that Tago Mago (1971) is the high mark, but the gentler Future Days (1974) is a sentimental favourite. Mad respect to Holger Czukay (RIP) for his startling solo albums (and music videos!).

# Neu!

They produced three albums, but you could argue that they only wrote one song. Hah! (Wonder if that joke's been made before...) Ther debut album (1972) is the best, but Neu! '75 is a very decent swansong. The 26 minutes of actual material in Neu! 2 is also good (ignore those who claim the filler varispeed remixes that flesh out the album is an "innovative" precursor of remix culture; in reality it's a desperate attempt to bump an EP or mini album's worth of material to a full album status in order to recoup costs, and it's kind of embarrassing).

A shoutout to Klaus Dinger's band La Dusseldorf. The motorik pop of the first album is excellent, though his singing is pretty atrocious.

# Cluster

Cluster began life spelt with a K, with the barking Conrad Schnitzler added to the ranks of mainstays Mobius and Roedelius. Their two quasi-religious albums are worth listening to, at least once. After Kluster became Cluster, the first two albums were walls of angry electronic buzzing. Perhaps the least expected thing happened next: using Michael Rother's gear once he wasn't around, Cluster produced the ridiculously melodic Zuckerzeit (1974). A more mellow followup, Sowiesoso (1976). More albums might have happened had Cluster not been collaborating with Rother and Eno for much of the period. Cluster continued into the 80s and beyond, but Sowiesoso can be considered their final classic Krautrock album.

# Harmonia

Harmonia consisted of Cluster plus Michael Rother. I've already given high praise for their track Watussi. The two albums they released are mixed bags: frontloaded with top notch material, leaving B languishing with a series of lower quality material. It's a reasonably scant catalogue, but it's been bolstered in more recent times with the release of long lost tapes Eno recorded with them in 1976 ("Tracks and Traces"), plus a very good live album from originally recorded in 1974, but released last decade.

(It's perhaps a bit rude, but it's tempting to think this corner of the Krautrock milieu as the "Neumonia" movement).

# Ash Ra Tempel

The first, eponymous album is very good, as is Schwingunen (1972). The album with Timothy Leary(!) is at least intriguing, while the songs for 

# Klaus Schulze

I've listened twice through Schulze's 70s albums and I've never been able to enjoy them. Yet many rate him highly, so I'm a bit confused. My main complaint about his works is that they're pretty flat. Each track sets up a single premise: usually a sequencer with Schulze noodling away live on a keyboard: the so-called "Berlin School". My criticism of Schulze is that his tracks tended to be rather static in terms of development. Tangerine Dream's sequencer-based tracks had more dynamic contrast in mood and arrangement. Much of this might be that "classic" TD had three members, whereas Schulze was on his own, and the difference may be down to greater variety you can get with three concurrent performers vs one.

That said, Schulze had a varying career, and was a free spirit, collaborating with many different artists, so I'm reluctant to write him off for his early albums. I'm hope one day I'll "get it".

# Manuel Gottsching

My favourite Gottsching album is Inventions for Electric Guitar (1974). E2-E4 (1982) is considered his classic. New Age on Earth (1976) was a spirited flirtation with New Age music.

# Conny Plank

It's worth shouting out Conny Plank, the master producer who worked with Kraftwerk, Cluster, Neu!, and Harmonia.

# Others

I never got Faust or Guru Guru (though Manny Neumeier did some great drumming on Harmonia's second album). Amon Duul II's Yeti is ok.

While I'm here I might as well namecheck the supreme nutter of the German avant gard, Karlheinz Stockhausen. Although Irmin Schmidt and Holger Czukay were some-time students of Stockhausen's, there's not much crossover, though he would have been a big part of the milieu that informed Krautrock.

# Kosmischer Läufer

Kosmischer Läufer: The Secret Cosmic Music of the East German Olympic Program 1972 – 83 is a series of albums released from 2013 - 2023. The music is purportedly by East German composer "Martin Zeichnete" and composed in the 1970s, intended as workout music for athletes. The production is clearly modern, and Wikipedia points the finger at Scottish composer Drew McFadyen.

The music itself is a pastiche of Krautrock. Nothing particularly remarkable about that at all, but the pastiche is admirably accurate, reliably sounding like Neumonia or Kraftwerk, with a splash of proggery thrown in.

The reason I include Kosmischer Läufer in this survey is that even though it that the krautrockery is so well observed, and the devotion to Krautrock so sincere, that I don't have it in me to say that it's not. If the style and methods are largely the same, the main difference is the intent. Krautrock never tried to sound like anything particular, whereas is specifically trying to mimic Krautrock.

# Krautrock evolution - decline and New Age fall

One of the curious features of Krautrock evolution is a mid-70s push from earlier wild, noisy experiementalism to a more pleasant, New Age sensibility. What was that about? A clue is from Michael Rother's that being in Harmonia, while artistically fruitful, was financially perilous. His first album of pleasant New Age strummings was so successful that continuing in that vein was his only option, at least until decades passed and his early work gained a decent following.

Does this explain why Tangerine Dream, Cluster, Manuel Gottsching, and even Can developed more "commercial" sounds in the late 1970s? Well, I think it's fair that while poverty in your early 20s is tolerable and if you have a Vision, at some point the imperative to make a crust is going to weigh on you, esp if you see your peers doing well. While there's a view that bands chasing dollars is "selling out", or just not "Rock'n'Roll", I take the glass-half-full view that it's remarkable that people make a vow of poverty in the first place, and wanting to cash in is merely reversion to the mean.Decline in a movement is inevitable as people get older and priorities change.

Kraftwerk arguably "sold out" first, perhaps accidentally, when in 1975 Autobahn was an unexpected Transatlantic hit. Without compromising their approach they pivoted wholly to technopop glory, and the rest is history. Admittedly after 1981 they stopped producing classic albums, but by then they were a sort of Gilbert and George art project than a rock act, and they had plenty of material to tour with, and they've remained a going concern ever since.

For the other Krautrockers, the 80s was pretty bleak. Tangerine Dream made money with Hollywood scores, but their albums settled into a New Age blandness. Mobius and Rodelius in Cluster were in a no-man's land either trying to get hip (1979's Grosse Wasser featured modern synths) or being strangely retrograde (1981's Vienna live album sees them producing a noise-fog similar to what they were doing a decade earlier). Solo albums and further collaborations with Conny Plank and Manny Neumaier in particular were entertaining, but don't give a sense of a group of artists with a strong sense of direction.

The only Can member consistently producing good material during the period was Holger Czukay. He managed to forge on with an entertaining manic avant jazz. It certainly didn't reach the heights of Tago Mago, but it was extremely entertaining.

The 90s brought a bit of respite as Krautrock got a critical re-evaluation as 90s bands name-checked them. I guess I was a participant in that process. I'm not sure Krautrock was rescued from obscurity, exactly, but I'm sure (well, hope) that renewed interest brought more income...

# What was it all about?

Growing up I saw Krautrock as a German response to psychedelia and late 60s youth movements. It seemed to me that the Germans took a deeper, more serious approach to these subjects than Anglo-American rockers did. The Krautrock: the Rebirth of Germany documentary adds the element of rebellion against the krautrockers' parents generation, or at least the need to reinvent German culture to remove the stain of Nazism. As interviews with Krautrockers back up this thesis, it's pretty compelling, and I think goes a long way to explain why Krautrock was more _heartfelt_ and profound than contemporary music from other countries. The extremeness of Krautrock is a result of the powerful legacy of World War II. A further implication is that the artistic flowering of Krautrock is going to be very rare. I find this deeply dispiriting as I appreciate the power of art _movements_ to generate a lot of extraordinary material by feeding off each others' ideas.

# The Legacy of Krautrock

German electronica has flourished into the 20th Century, though how much of contemporary German ambient or techno relies directly on the Krautrock legacy, rather than its legacy on other styles (Kraftwerk on House, TD/Neumonia on ambient music) that more directly influenced them, I'm not sure.
