We flew! The main thing of note is that we flew on a 787 for the first time. Angus was pleased - he's been watching a lot of YouTube videos about planes lately, and had watched a vid about the mechanics of the planes the previous day.

At Narita airport I disgraced myself by getting off the express heading to Tokyo just as it was leaving. They let me back on, but it was very embarrassing. Why did I get off? Well, I had just used the bathroom (very nice facilities, by the way) when there was a family with a pram and screaming child between me and my family. I thought it would be easier just to go out one door, run to the next one, and hop back on, but I hadn't checked if the train was leaving. It was. A barrier of clothesline-like cords rolled up and I couldn't get back on. I shrief "Oh come on," and a platform attendant was a bit confused. Sally came to the door to bark furiously at me. This sort of scenario for her is the stuff of nightmares; when on holiday (and not, actually) I often do random and inexplicable things.

Luckily I was allowed back on, and I received a brief and deserved telling off from my dear wife. Strangely the worst I felt was for making the train perhaps 20 seconds late. The Japanese are fastidious about their timetables. Had I caused the driver distress?

We got into Shibuya about an hour later and checked in to our handily local hotel. It's a boutique affair called Miyashita(check?) Sequence, which Sally told me was aimed at influencers(?!). It had a checkin system involving a touchscreen that spits out keycards. The idea is sound, but the interface wasn't optimised for New Zealanders, and eventually we gave up and obtained human assistance.

Absolutely knackered, we went straight to bed.

# Dec 16 2022

We came to at around 4:30. Sally and I would have drifted off, but Gus was having none of it. We mucked around for a couple of hours, then went and had breakfast. The hotel provided a series of breakfasts that was delicious. As we ate we were serenaded by tinklin New Age music, and the view of the streets of Shibuya below was remarklable. What's Shibuya? Well, it's a city inside Tokyo, one of mnay. The chief attraction of Shibuya is shopping and its famous intersection where, at certain times of the day, thousands of people will weave around each other as they cross the street.

Our bellies well and truly stuffed, the first order of business was to visit Yayoi Kusama's museum. If you're not aware of her, she's a Japanese artist who works with dots and colour in abstractions. She says that her art reflects hallucinations and other visual turmoil that she has experienced since childhood. Such is her torment that she's lived on the grounds of a mental institution for several decades.

Now, I'm a little sceptical about all this. Kusama was part of the New York art scene in the 1960s, and all this sounds like Warholish BS. Additionally, her art is _fun_, and definitely crowd-pleasing. Finally, Kusama is so famous, and her art so well circulated and curated, and created using readily mass-producable materials (eg, plastic, steel, fibreglass) that I get the sense that she's more commercial enterprise than outsider artist.

Am I being too cynical? Maybe. In any event, I still like what she does.

The museum itself was a curious affair. It's quite small, and while Sally's research suggested 90 minutes could be spent there, we blitzed it in 20. Even stranger, the official flow of movement through the museum is from the gorund up - we were forbidden from descending the stairs, and had to take the elevator back to the ground floor when done. Now for us it makes sense to get the lift up and descend by the stairs. I suppose Museum management might be keen on patrons getting more exercise, but otherwise it seemed a bit unfair on the infirm.

Aside from this back to frontness, the material on display was as Kusama as you would wish. My highlght was a mirrored cube covered with circles and hemispheres of coloured glass. Look into them and the mirrors did their work, transforming the view inside the box into an infinite vista of other people's eyes looking at you. Best still, the view through each hole was different. I guess it's a pretty simple idea, but the result was great.

After the museum we caught a bus back to Shibuya. We'd caught the Tokyo metro up to the museum, and Sally thought it would be interesting to have a slower trip back and see the sights. The trip was long, but pleasant enough. So I've been to Japan 6 times now and there's always something new to discover. On this bus trip I discovered monotony. I was intrigued to find a lack of distinct character in the urban environment. Until we passed Harajuku and saw several stadiums, there was not much change to distinguish one place from another. In fact most of what I guess you'd call the inner suburbs of Tokyo seem to have been created _ex nihilo_ in the 1980s. I find this striking because Wellington's surviving architecture spans 100 years, and its topography (hills and harbour and whatnot) make each suburb pretty unique. I realise Japan's a bit different. Houses and buildings, aside from prestige buildings - temples, palaces, castles, and suchlike, are designed to be light and fairly disposable. This is a response to earthquakes (and their resulting fires), which makes sense. But maybe in the last 50 years hundreds of thousands of red and grey and beige and terracotta housaing buildings have gone up and they're dreary. In Hong Kong the housing developments are at least imposing 40 storey behemoths, which often flow like dominos along hillsides. In Tokyo they all add up to a flat exapanse of meh.

We wended our way back to Shibuya station, and, feeling a bit jetlagged, we retreated to our hotel room for a brief rest. It was midday, but because our breakfast was massive and filling, we weren't hungry yet. We decided to head back to Shibuya station to the "scramble", a skyscraper with a rooftop view. We went up and beheld the world's greatest connurbation. Angus was initially in good spirits, being fascinated by the "ants" at the famous intersection far below. But around 3 o'clock hunger set in after we'd eaten only minimally. He wasn't the only one; I was fast becoming ravenous.

The problem was that Sally wanted to stay on the roof until sunset. She likes collecting photos of sunsets from tall buildings. She's been pretty successful, notching up 30 Rockerfeller Plaza in New York, Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris (before the fire), and, about 10 years ago, another skyscraper in Tokyo, this one in Roppongi Hills [need correct name!].

Now I'm seasoned at this, so wasn't going to grumble, but Angus wasn't having it. Very suddenly he became insistent that he was very hungry and needed food now. Well, we managed to keep a lid on him for a while, and took plenty of photos. Luckily Sally decided it was too cold and wandered back.

Oh, I've forgotten to describe the view. Well, imagine going up dozens of stories, looking out, and seeing nothing but city from horizon to horizon. Periodically clusters of skyscrapers erupt out of the grey/white expanse - Shinjuku, (the area with the Sky Tree), Roppongi, all large metropolises in their own right. It's a remarkable view.

There was one imposing non human-made feature: Mount Fuji, looming faint in the glare of the late afternoon sun. It may have been hard to see but it was still impressive, and very dignified. And very Japanese!

Being tired, jetlagged, and hungry, we opted for convenience and descended to the basement of the building where there was a sort of foot market. There we bought some sushi and katsu chicken, took it back to our hotel and unceremoniously consumed it.

After this I ventured out on my own to check out the famous Tower Records building - a whole building containing music! I'd visited it before back 2013 and found it a bit disappointing - I think I'd been hoping to find a CD reissue of some 1970s space rock classic, but was unable to. (I suspect there will be dozens of small boutiques where you can find that sort of thing if you're up to it.) Ten years and Spotify later I wasn't so much interested in finding music for myself but just checking out the scene. The result was about as awkward as you'd expect when a middle aged European man strolls around a shop aimed at yoofs. One thing that struck me is there's still enough interest in physical music formats to support a building full of it (that said, floors 8 and 9 of Tower records aren't currently used...)

The earlier levels were focused more on Jpop and more specific subgenres. It was intriguing enough. Teens were mostly concentrated these floors, and the fifth floor, devoted to K-pop. Given the Korean/Japanese rivalry, this was amusing to see. There's lots of different J-pops, but unless it's weird, I prefer K-pop, for sure.

The higher floors were more European. Level 7 had a section devoted to classical CDs of such size I was nearly moved to tears. There were some oddities: one wall was festooned with vinyl classics like Bjork's Debut, Nirvana's In Utero, and The Smiths' the Queen is Dead. It was almost what I listening to at high school in 1993, except vinyl was dead at that point. Stranger still, when I returned to the ground floor on the way out I saw a stack of Mariah Carey's Christmas album on vinyl. In 2023. I get why, but it really makes no sense.

Back on the street the nightlife was beginning to get going, but I couldn't think of anything else I wanted to see so I returned to the hotel. In the middle of the night I was woken up by rhythmic bass thudding. Normally this would be club music - a repetitive kick drum pulse. Instead, there was rapid thudding, followed by a pause, followed by a tempo modulation, followed by... was that a time signature change? Trying to piece all that together I came to an inescapable conclusion: J-metal, in Shibuya, At 3am on a Saturday morning.

Today was about trains. We caught a train from Shibuya to a place called a Omiya, an then caught a light train ("New Shuttle", it was called) to a train museum, then we caught the light train back to Omiya, then a Shinkansen (an E5 Yamabiko!) to Tokyo station. We then caught an N700a train (line?) to Kyoto.

Now as you should know the Japanese love their trains, and in the post War period when America and some parts of Europe (the UK in particular) stopped investing in rail in favour of cars and planes, the Japanese continued, building out the Shinkansen network. As I write I'm traversing 535km from Tokyo to Kyoto in just 2.5 hours. True, that's slower than a plane flight of the same distance, but I'm not sardined in a cabin. And there's decent wifi.

The Japanese reverence for trains is part of a deep faith in modernity. After the War the West gave up on rail in favour of highways, but Japan doubled down with the Shinkansen network, which makes the traversal of the company an absolute pleasure. There's a lot to celebrate, and the country has numerous rail museums.

In 2019 we took Angus to the Kyoto and Nagoya train museums, but we hadn't been to the Tokyo one. This museum is famous (in Japan) for being the place from which boy-operated transforming robot trains emanate in the children's anime Shinkalion Henkei Robo. This show was Angus's initial introduction to Japan (via a cantonese dub) as a preschooler.

The Tokyo museum featured lots of trains, a few simulators, a mini railway, a very quiet and comfy library. For lunch Angus got a bento box in the shape of a shinkansen train.

# December 18 2022

We got up and out early to visit [get name of place with hill of gates]. It's a hill with paths you walk up that are corridors (uncovered of torii gates, a traditional Japanese construction. I'm not sure what the purpose of the gates (I realise 20 seconds on Google would give me the answer but I have thousands of words to write, so please excuse me), but I'd guess that each one is a donated by member of the public to curry favour with the gods, or rebalance karma, or suchlike. The day was cold but relatively fine, and the paths relatively uncrowded, and all should have been relatively serene. However Angus was totally not into it.

Now I should pause here to write about our boy and how good he was on this trip. With some kids, the attention deficit disorder is so great that the best you can do holiday-wise is book in at a resort and let them loose on the water park amenities. Generally however, Angus is reasonably happy to tag along as we visit galleries and temples and things like that. Aside from train museums, most of our destinations were pitched at Sally or me. We were confident Gus would be ok with this, but even so, a lot of other kids would have been bored witless. So, overall, aside from the odd grumble, he was pretty good.

But not today. He moaned and groaned up and down the hill and generally put a downer on what would have been a zennish experience. Worse still was his failure to comply to Sally's requests for selfies. You just don't do that... We coped as best we could but it was an unhappy experience.

Of the hill walk itself, two features: one was notices that we should watch out for sudden attacks by wild boar living on the hill. Sadly (or luckily) none were forthcoming. Another noticed warned women not to walk about alone. Charming. Finally, the hill was maintained well, except for a shrine by a pond which, inexplicably, had a pile of rubbish at the water's edge more or less right in front of us. If it had been recently collected and was awaiting retrieval that might have made some sense, but I got the feeling it was an old pile of old rubbish, which was a bit baffling. It was another example of Japanese consideration and attention to detail being all-encompassing until it mysteriously wasn't.

Coming down off the hill we were in a well-to-do neighbourhood. House sections in Japan are restricted pretty much to the land the house is built on, but what or two houses had elaborate (if small) bonsai gardens. Most of the trees had lost their leaves, but one or two, startlingly, remained radiantly golden.

Eventually we returned to a station and caught the train back into Kyoto station. Another short ride along we visited the Kyoto Rail Museum. I know what you're thinking, _another_ train museum, a day after the last one? Yeah, I was thinking that too, esp as we'd visited this museum before. Luckily this visit was somewhat more perfunctory, the highlight being a brief but charming ride on an old steam train.

# December 19 2022

The plan was to catch three or maybe four(?) trains and two ferries to get to the famed "art island" of Naoshima. The first two (or maybe three?) train legs went well, but when we got to Okayama we found the Uno line was down (too many reverse cards, maybe?). Outside the station entrance, we ended up in a tense struggle with some other tourists over the who would get the next taxi. We won, and had a mad rush down to Uno to make the ferry in time.

As we raced against time I felt a sense of elation. The taxi driver was an amiable superannuated gent who whipped out random geographical facts as we went ("300 hundred years ago, all this was under water", was one I remember). We drove along country lanes between fallow rice paddies. After the dull metropoli of Tokyo and Kyoto this was quite refreshing.

After a bit of iffy driving we got to the terminal with a couple of minutes to spare, and dashed onto the ferry bound to Teshima.

The ferry was small but felt familiar. The weather was crisp but sunny and the collection of small islands about felt slightly (if you closed your eyes 80%) like the Marlborough sounds. Admittedly the smokestacks dotted about the landscape kind of detracted from that, but still, I enjoyed the ride.

Before we go further, I should explain the set up for Naoshima. The "Art Island" concept dates from the 1980s, when Tetsuhiko Fukutake of Okayama-based Fukutake Publishing (later renamed Benese; fun fact: Berlitz Language Schools are a subsidiary) decided it would be nice to have art galleries in a more natural environment, and picked Naoshima as the ideal site for the project. The first part of the project was complete in the mid 90s and the Benesse Foundation has continued to build from there, with installations all over Naoshima, and also on adjacent islands including Teshima. The benefit for the islanders, presumably, is jobs and tourist dollars.

Anyway, first stop was a bus ride up the hill to the Teshima Art Museum. The museum consists of two concrete dome structures, one featuring the cafe and shop, and the other the museum itself. "Museum" is a bit of a misnomer, as it's really just a single installation: a dome with holes at two ends. What's inside the dome? Aside from the two attendents (there to make sure you wear the correct slippers, and don't take pictures, stand in the wrong place, or make loud noises) the space is empty except for stray leaves and puddles of water. Turns out the water is the point. It seems out of the ground in drops, which gradually move and coalesce into larger puddles. This process was initially curious, not least how the dropslets didn't seep into the concrete (my theory: a water repellent sealant, or else super-special concrete).

The space is very peaceful, and (for our visit at least) mostly empty. I endjoyed looking out the (unglassed) holes in the dome and seeing the frames view of the sky/trees/clouds. The feel was minimalist and austere and kind of 1970s Science Fiction, which is my find of thing.

What I wish I could have done is record the impulse response of the space. Recently the software I use to manipulate sounds (it's a hobby) obtained a plugin that allows you to use recordings of the acoustic of a space as a generic reverberation that other sounds can be played through. The way to record such a sound (probably not acoustically correct, but does the job) is to record the reverberations after making a sharp noise (clapping being the easiest to perform). As I brought a cheap but decent sound recorder with me I was desperate to record clapping at different points of the space but I suspect I would have caused the attendants great consternation.

We spent maybe 20 minutes in the dome and then a further quarter hour in the cafe sharing a coffee and a modestly sized piece of strawberry spongecake. Then we wandered down the hill to a village. We needed to catch a bus, and we found, at the bus stop, the most curious thing, a van selling various bready goods, piping out 60s organ exotica music. Hovering around the van were various local folk (all men) chatting away. As we hadn't had any lunch (aside from the aforementioned spongecake), we bought several items to nom our way through.

We caught the bus to another village to a small art gallery in a converted house. There was lots of coloured glass and strange paintings and rock gardens. The best bit was that the toilets were festooned with mirrored glass and artworks in their own right. One of these was functional for punters, while the other was strictly to be stared at, so while Angus used one toilet, I gawped at the other one.

Our next stop was a strawberry themed dessert place. Angus had a sundae, while Sally and I shared crepes. At this point we were killing time until the ferry. After we felt it was too rude to hang out there any longer, we waited at the ferry for another 45 minutes. Finally we set sail for Naoshima.

Our first night at the art island was spent in a hotel called My Lodge, which had a theme of being decorated with Muji products. If you don't know Muji, it's a Japanese department store which holds to a minimalist, Northern Europeanish design aesthetic, and likes to play folkish world music. Sally's been a big fan for as long as I've known her. You don't get between her and a Muji, I can tell you!

It was nice. Sadly, the day we turned up no eateries were open, so we dined on 7/11 food.

# December 20 2022

The next morning we ate a modest breakfast at the hotel, then caught a bus to the Chuchi Museum, on the other side of the island. This is the main museum of the Art Island, and features a series of concrete galleries recessed into a hillside (or at least cladded with hillside) in a manner intended to be complementary with the environment.

The main impression I had of Bernesse Museum was concrete. The same concrete panels were present all over the island, in fact, and I enjoyed the cold brutalist aesthetic. In fact as we wandered about I half fantasised I was on Arrakis, the world of Dune. Less constrained than I'd been at the Teshima Art museum, I went about recording impulse responses as best I could given other visitors (most especially my son) were also making noises.

Oh, and there was also art in the Museum. One room features a water lilly painting by Monet, in his abstract, "I've had my cataracts out without having my lenses replaced so all I can see now is diffuse colours" phase. What interested me most was the prevalence of fairly drab colour in the painting, given the often lurid palettes of his earlier works like the many paintings of Rouen(?) Cathedral, or all those blody haystacks. I've tended towards highly saturated colours as I've gotten older, but I found Monet's restraint quite intriguing. It's also possible the lighting was too dim.

Another room was by John Turrell[check name], a clever space where viewers were drawn into (another) dimly lit space, and gradual changes in lighting caused our perception of one wall to change.

I think I should have foud Turrell's work the most impressive, but I was rather more drawn to a dramatic space filled with a giant polished stone sphere with golden sticks of wood with triangular (think Toblerone), square, and pentangular cross sections. There were variations in the arrangement of these sticks which probably meant something mathematical, but I was most reminded of temples with many statues of golden Buddhist saints. Perhaps that was an additional intended effect. Anywyay, the whole thing felt (once again) 1970s science fiction, and I'd have liked to have spent longer there.

Eventually we exited and ate lunch in the impeccable restaurant attached to the museum, which had a sunny view out over the bay. Thereafter we wandered down the hill to the Tadao Ando [check this, not sure if it was] Museum. At first we wandered around a few outdoor objects, but then I spotted another concrete corridor, and I proceeded to record more impulse responses. I thought this area was a sort of anonymous sort labyrinth, but we turned a couple of corners and found the entrance to a museum. What the museum staff thought of all the lunatic clapping going on, I don't know.

This museum was more of the same minimal art. Along with the Bernesse Museum it felt like a lot of space and volume to devote to a relatively small number of artworks (all permanent, too) but I have to concede this approach makes the museum absolutely one of a kind.

Over the road was [something] valley, which featured a series of small Buddha sculptures made from industrial waste, and a couple of artworks by Yayoi Kusama (who also has a couple of fibreglass pumpkins gracing the island). These works featured steel mirror balls, a large number of which sat on a pond and made tinkling sounds whenever the wind pushed them together. (I tried to make a recording, but the same wind produced excessive noise across the microphone to make a satisfactory recording.) It was decent enough, but globular mirrors (and mirrors in general) in art seems to be quite common (think of old Jeff Kuhns[spelling?!]). I really should leave her alone. 

We walked a bit further past another few random outdoor sculptures until we had afternoon tea in a seaside outpost of the Bernesse Hotel. After taking some photos of an obligatory Kusama fibreglass pumpkin, we caught a bus up the hill to the Bernesse Hotel, our lodgings for the night.

The Hotel feels like an extension of the Chuchi Museum (although I think the hotel was built first). This is because the hotel features several large galleries. The hotel is also rather pricey, so pricey in fact she wouldn't tell me how much it cost to stay there. The room was a little tired, but it certainly was a unique hotel, so I wasn't going to complain.

Sally had also splashed out on dinner. The restaurant was so fancy that children under six were banned! For me Sally had preordered a King's Feast, a six course meal. That sounded a bit daunting to me - I've never been keen on huge meals. Things became especially fraught when the first course turned up containing several sets of dishes that I assumed must be multiple courses, only to discover they only summed to one. As it turned out, the meal was big on light foods such as fish and vegetables, so not too heavy going. Plus I got to share with Sally and Angus (who had more modest meals). The food tasted very good, but I have to confess I'm not much of a gourmand, and the highlight of the day for me was all that reverberant concrete.

After dinner we wandered around the museum space a bit more, enjoying its emptiness. We then retired to our room.

# December 21

The next morning we had breakfast at the place by the beach then packed up to leave Naoshima. Final thoughts? It was good! Turns out there are installations on other islands. I think it might be good to spend a week in the area some time. Probably not that whole week at Hotel Bernese though, it might bankrupt us.

We bussed down the hill to view one more gallery, another piece by Turrell. In this one you get led into a dark space and asked to sit down. There you wait a few minutes. Slowly, your eyes become aware of a rectangle in front of you. After the required amount of time the attendant announced that what you can see now was always there and the reason you couldn't see it before is that your eyes needed to adjust to the darkness.

Unlike the Turrell work up the hill that did a few things, I felt this work wasn't so good. From my hobby of astronomy, I'm well aware eyes need time to adjust to low light, so I wasn't impressed at all. Tough crowd!

We caught a ferry to Uno and caught a train to Kurashiki. Kurashiki didn't seem up to much until we reached the old quarter, a set of streets with well preserved old buildings with a canal running through them. Sally explained that Kurashiki was previously the home of denim in Japan, and this tradition was maintained by a series of very expensive jeans shops. Although the weather was grey and air cold, I quite liked it. We later wandered down an old market street looking for dinner, but the vibe was a bit abandoned. Perhaps inevitably we ended up back in the train station. No eateries that weren't similar to what we'd recently eaten could be found, and inevitably we searched for the nearest Maccas. Google maps told us it was over the road, and we found ourselves in a shopping mall. The meal was delicious! It was a far cry from Bernesse Hotel and the King's Feast a day earlier, but if I'm being brutally honest, gave me about the same amount of enjoyment. Philistine! Afterwards we went about the mall. I picked up the Winter Jojo's Bizarre's Adventure magazine (which contained many pages of fluff), while Sally and Angus browsed a large collection of Bandai toy capsule dispensers.

# December 22

The next morning we returned to the old quarter to visit the Ohara Museum, a startingly European building complete with Ionic columns. Inside was the collection of Ohara Magosaburo, an early 20th Century Western art collector. He had good taste - lots of impressionists and early modernists and, somewhat anomalously, an El Greco. There were also some contemporary works that were in keeping with the older stuff. I really liked it.

Still in the museum, we translated to a set of old houses that contained Japanese and some Chinese art. I can mainly only remember the pottery. There were inevitably green and brown Chinese pottery horses, from the Dynasty known for green and brown pottery horses. It was ok, but I more enjoyed wending through the houses in unexpected ways.

After exiting the museum we picked up our bags, made for the station. As we had time we briefly returned to the mall where we'd had dinner the night before. Next door to the Maccas we'd seen a cat cafe, and Sally was keen to take Gus in, both saving money and giving me a break by leaving me outside. Fine by me!

So a pet cafe is a Japanese invention where you get to interact with animals and have a coffee. In a country where fewer pets are kept, this makes more sense than it might seem. The previous night we'd watched the cats get fed. The animals were interesting, many of them were a breed with tiny ears that tend to feature in cute Japanese cat videos (I mean haven't seen a lot of these, but I have seen some...). There were two grey cats that were in a constant state of war (with one of the greys prone to attacking just about everyone). I tend to be a bit dubious about this sort of thing in terms of animal welfare, but as an experience for Sally and Angus it was fascinating. (Afterwards, Sally complained that the animals didn't really give her the time of day. My assessment is that there's not much need to interact with humans when you're constantly living cheek by jowl with a dozen other cats...)

After all, we caught another N700 train off to Hiroshima. In 2003 Sally and I visited Nagasaki, the "other one that got nuked", so I felt I'd ticked the nuclear pilgrimage box. However, since we were in the area, I wasn't going to say no. Angus had showed a slightly morbid interest in nuclear weaponry, so we thought it might be useful to round out his education on that front (he's pretty young but we felt it would be better to learn about like this than, as I had done, from the febrile minds of classmates with older siblings).

We got out at Hiroshima station and caught the tram to our Hotel, the Knot, which wasn't far from the Hiroshima Peace Park. The tram ride was kind of groovy, and I was immediately struck by how modern and affluent the city felt. Our hotel was pretty flash too, with a rooftop bar that afforded a wonderful view of the city around us.

Before dinner we did a brief wander out to the Atomic Bomb Dome, a structure that had the fortune to stay intact despite the nuclear fireball that descended on it from about 660 vertically and 190m horizontally from it.

A couple of streets away we found a restaurant that was famous for its okomonoyaki, a Japanese omelette. Unfortunately lots of people had the same idea, and we had to queue for about half an hour. It was worth the wait, and we sat in a booth staring at a row of workers breaking eggs over a long steel hotplate, smooshing them around, dropping various ingredients into them, and eventually scraping them up and onto plates for customers. The food was tasty, too.

A short walk back to our hotel and we settled in for the night. I had a shower, and on coming out Sally and Angus announced that it was snowing. I peered out the window, and snowflakes were indeed falling. Neat!

# December 23

Snow was still falling when we awoke, and there was a decent coverage on the ground. I think this might have been Gus' first experience of snow in a city environment. He seemed impressed. So did the TV news, with NHK (with a Hiroshima office quartered in a building opposite our hotel) explaining at length about the snow, and crossing to cold-looking reporters in various locations. I'm not sure, but it might have been the first snowfall of the season.

We hadn't really been expecting snow, except in the Japanese Alps, taking the view that since Japan is at much the same latitude as New Zealand, the climate should be broadly comparable. Of course, New Zealand doesn't have Siberia directly to the north, which changes the things a bit.

In any event, our visit to the Hiroshima Atomic Bomb museum [check for real name] and the Peace Park was conducted in a snowy setting. Angus was very keen to construct snow balls and lob them at us, and Sally and I were generally happy to let him lob them at us (his aim was often rubbish, to be fair, and he hadn't yet discovered trolling behaviour like stuffing snow down the back of our shirts).

So, the Atomic Bomb Museum. I had memories of finding the Nagasaki Museum, with its stark depiction of horrific injuries, very hard to take. The Hiroshima museum's pictures were black and white, which I think helped. Even so, there was plenty of suffering on display. I don't think Angus was traumatised by it.

After being ushered into a separate hall we received information about the geopolitical context of the attack. The account was very much from a Japanese perspective, emphasising that the Americans gave no warning of the attack, were happy to indiscriminately kill civilians. While the attack on Pearl Harbour was mentioned, Japanese atrocities on the Asian mainland weren't, giving the impression that American attacks on Japan were for revenge, rather than the necessary elimination of a dangerously imperialistic regime. There was also an implication that the usage of the atom bomb was a warning to the Soviet Union rather than for strategic use against Japan.

To my mind all this seems a bit self-serving, and kind of detracts from the museum's blunt portrayal of the horror of the blast.

Outside the museum, the focus was on peace, something I could get behind. There was a memorial to the dead children that featured X, who made all the paper cranes while dying from cancer in the hope that her wish to live might be granted. Well, she lives on as part of a highly heroic (even mythic) statue form. Elsewhere Angus and I rang peace bells (Gus complained that I rang mine too loudly), and Sally took many photos.

We had lunch, then trammed to the train station, where we caught a train back to Kyoto. Leaving Hiroshima I felt regret we'd only spent one night there. Some other time, perhaps.

Back in Kyoto station we wandered out the back to our hotel under Kyoto Tower. The Tower dates back to the 60s and is a more truncated affair than others we've been in. After checking in we first tackled the tower. Out of the lift we found it was a fairly cramped space, with a lot of iron and bolts. Very 60s. The view was of course good, and power (and free!) binoculars revealed many sights. It was the first time I got a sense of Kyoto as a city.

That night we ate out of a 7/11 (oof) in our hotel room. The room Sally had booked had a concept: one corner was given over to a steering wheel and dashboard of a Kyoto bus. A screen directly in front displayed video of a drive around Kyoto. The illusion was hardly seamless, as turning the wheel did not change the video at all. It was a decent diversion for kindergartners, but Gus was perhaps a little too old for it. That didn't stop him from having a good go at it though.

A more significant problem with the room was the lack of double glazing, and the provision of a floor heater to keep the room warm. What was this, New Zealand?? I don't know quite why the hotel was like this, but I suspect that the building being under Kyoto Tower, and dating back to the 1960s, might have had something to do with it.

We caught an early train out to [place with monkey park and bamboo forest]. The earliness was due to the park being popular. There was nary a soul when we arrived, although a street festooned with closed ice cream and other street food shops suggested potential for touristic hordes. Our first stop was a small bamboo forest with a path running through. By the time we got there several other groups of tourists were present. We all contended with each other to get perfect photographs of ourselves with the dark bamboo sprouting up above us. There was a bit of stress as punters walked into shot. The most extreme presence was a couple done up in wedding gear getting some perfect photos. I was astonished at the bride in standing bare shouldered in 3 degree conditions, but I suspect there was a mother or friend of the bride with a heavy coat waiting close by. By God, I certainly hope so!

The next stop was the monkey park. Japan is home to the Japanese macaque, a red-faced old-world monkey. We walked up a steep slope and soon saw monkeys leaping around from tree to tree and squeaking at each other. At the very top was an area for monkeys to scamper around and a small building from which people could feed the monkeys peanuts through a metal grill. The macaques were competitive and frequently fighting. Innumerable signs told us not to get within two metres of the monkeys, or look them directly in the eye lest our manner be interpreted as a dominance display and cause a monkey to go, well, apeshit. As it was the monkeys didn't seem to fussed about us at all, and scampered past us at any distance they pleased. Inside the "pavilion" (of sorts), we fed some monkeys a bag of peanuts. It was good.

Coming down the hill, we met the recently arrived tourist hordes awaited us. I'm guessing that by summer standards there was hardly anyone, but compared to Teshima there were a fair few people. Dodging the other punters we stopped in at a very elegant soba restaurant. The chief interest of this place was that it played the same three short pieces of classical music over and over again. We were once in a tea house in Shiragawa Go that played a single movement of Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony over and over, so by those standards, I guess this was pretty generous. As someone who thinks a one hour spotify playlist is a bit on the light side, I found the thinking behind this monotony hard to understand. I guess the idea was that the music should maintain a feeling, so fewer pieces was better. And perhaps we weren't supposed to pay such close attention? Hard to say.

Afterwards we caught a train back into Kyoto. Our next destination was a shop where Sally could buy a refill for a special pen. This took us through what appeared to be the main shopping district of Kyoto. I don't know if I've mentioned earlier but I've never had a sense of Kyoto as a whole, or having "done" Kyoto (as opposed to "done bits of"). With this trip, and especially after scrutinising the city from the tower, I feel like the gaps are more filled in. Even so, I sense there's still much to be undiscovered, especially on the temple side of things.

The streets were very busy. If this was the West I'd say it was last minute Christmas shopping, but I'm not sure how much Japanese care about Christmas. They'll certainly roll out trees and tinsel, but I don't know how much Christmas tradition is observed.

We caught a bus back to the station and visited our next destination, QB House. This wonder of Japanese civilisation provided a heavily streamlined barber shop experience for those without time or money. As someone who fitted that mould, and in need of having my barnet seen to, I was keen to visit.

You pay 1300 yen (at time of writing about NZ$16) into a machine at the front, take a ticket, and wait. When you're called up, you explain what you want. For English speakers this involves pointing at a chart. I'm never sure whether to talk or not when getting barbered in NZ. Sometimes I'm feeling chatty, but mostly I'm not, but I never want to seem rude. In this situation, trying to make small talk upon a Japanese whose English probably wasn't very good or non-existent, so I kept very quiet. I thought she might be unfamiliar with Western skulls and hair, and consequently do a poor job, but as it turned out her work as excellent. Two peculiarities (for me at least) was that she vacuumed my head after to remove clipped hairs. Then she trimmed my blossoming ear hair with a specialised tool. What a professional! Well, I was pretty impressed. The cuts are supposed to be no more than 10 minutes, but mine stretched to 15. Sally was a bit horrified she'd gone over time - so inefficient! But I don't think there were too many customers waiting, so all was well.

Next it was off to another mall food court. This might seem a touch unclassy, but the reason was totally cultural. You see, since a wildly successful KFC promotion in the 1970s, KFC has been considered the traditional Christmas feast of Japan. (Forget turkey! Bugger ham! Etc.) Come November each year you can order a KFC Christmas meal from Japan. We hadn't ordered anything, but supposedly you could still bowl up and buy some chicken, so we rolled up for an authentic Japanese Christmas culinary experience.

On this day, Christmas Eve, the KFC in the food court had two 20 metre long queues. I'm not sure how the queues were differentiated, but when we joined one we were told that once we ordered it would take 40 minutes to get our order. I mean, KFC in NZ is reliably slower than Maccas, but jeez. We were content to take a photo of the phenomenon and get Indian and Korean from other shops.

We did a bit more browsing after that. The highlight for me was running into a popup store for Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, a manga/anime I've been obsessed with the past couple of years. This store was promoting the latest season. You could buy special merch, pose for a photo with various cardboard JoJo characters, and buy a JoJo themed dessert. I didn't do any of those things (though I did pick up a JoJo capsule nearby) because, well, though I might be obsessed, I need some boundaries...

# December 25

Christmas Day! We checked out of Kyoto and caught a train up to Kanazawa. Along the way we stopped to visit the [Site of Reversible Destiny](https://www.reversibledestiny.org/site-of-reversible-destiny-yoro/) in Yoro Park. Out the back of beyond, we got a surburban train to the site. At the station we wrestled with an aged gent who was attempting to help in his capacity at volunteer tourist helper. The wrestling was metaphorical, of course; he actually help-hindered us with stowing our luggage while we went off to Yoro Park. He meant well, but he made everything more of a hassle than it needed to be.

Yoro Park was about ten minutes (on foot) up the hill. The site has some weird looking buildings, and I was looking forward to investigating them. As it turned out, however, most of the park was closed because of weather. Now the weather on Christmas Day was fine, but there was lingering snow on the ground, and I suspect this was considered sufficient to be a safety risk.Ah, what a gyp! But the Reversible Destiny building itself remained open, and, as a concession to disgruntled visitors, free.

The concept behind the Reversible Destiny is that it's a house but with the layout scrambled and distorted. In practice the space was filled with truncated walls that had mirror copies on the ceiling. Sections were painted in different colours denoting different rooms (with colours popping up in multiple places to demonstrate the scramblage). It was interesting to climb the walls and jump about (Gus did plenty of that) and take photos.

However the building had a shabby feel - both exterior and interior paintwork needed a refresh, and I have to say I wasn't terribly impressed. It had me yearning a little for Wanaka's renowned Puzzling World. The did like the men's bathroom, but it wasn't enough to stop me from feeling that the detour had been a waste of our time. (To be fair, when we got back to NZ Gus and I watched a video of the place taken in summer and Yoro Park looked pretty amazing. Perhaps some other time...)

After little more than an hour we resumed our trip to Kanazawa. We'd been to the city twice before: in 2009 with Sally's cousin William, and in 2019 with Gus, Sally's sister Helen, and their mum and dad. We'd enjoyed both visits. The chief jewels of the city are the Museum of 21st Art, and Kanazawa Castle, with its renowned garden.

We checked into the Henna (strange) Hotel, the strangeness being solely that the automated checkin kiosks were attended by two animatronic velociraptors clad in psychedelic feathers. They wiggled and jiggled and provided commentary for the check in process in Japanese, English, Korean, and (I think) Mandarin.

Late afternoon we ventured out into the neighbourhood to find somewhere to eat. The best we could find was a place called Sassariya that did sort of European food. I orderd pizza and got pasta. Sally ordered snails and got snails, and she insisted we have some too. After all the seafood he'd had, Gus wasn't at all phased about eating a snail, so he did. For my part I can't say I would seek them out again, but I wasn't offended by them.

# December 26

Next morning we caught a train out to Hakui to visit the splendidly named [Cosmo Isle Space and UFOs Museum](https://www.ishikawatravel.jp/en/spots/cosmo-isle-hakui/). As a bit of a space fan I was pretty keen. We caught an E7 train up the line and once again got out, caught another surburban train into the middle of nowhere.

The Museum features a lot of space exploration hardware. Outside there's a Mercury/Redstone rocket from the dawn of Nasa spaceflight. There's an Apollo lunar rover at the entrance. Upstairs there's a Mercury capsule (tiny), a Soviet Vostok capsule (much roomier), an Apollo capsule, an Apollo lunar lander (suprisingly massive), a Nasa Viking Mars lander, and a full scale model of a Voyager space probe.

This is all serious stuff, and a pretty comprehensive survey of space exploration up to 1980. Curiously there was nothing about the Space Shuttle, or Japan's own space programme, or the International Space Station (of which Japan is a member nation). More curiously, the museum building feels fairly modern, so when planning it there should have been opportunity for an exhibit or two covering more recent developments. Admittedly part of the Museum was inaccessible, so perhaps there has been such a space, or will be?

A further curiosity was the attention the museum gives to UFOs. Given UFOs are clearly bunk, this material detracts from the high quality of the rest of the museum. A sort of explanation is given by the museum's website, that "the city of Hakui on the Noto Peninsula is known for having some of the highest rates of UFO sightings in Japan", but I mean, really...

Afterwards we went to the cafe which was only serving slushies. Outside there was slush everywhere on the ground, but Gus was keen. The cafe was festooned with posters of space exploration. None was from any later than about 1990. Now this could have been a conscious choice - in a nostalgic, retro way, but given the fading on the posters and the general feel of the place a simpler explanation is that the cafe had retained the same decor for the past 30 years.

So that was that. There seemed to be nothing else to do or eat between the museum and the train station - no shops at all, in fact - so we ate out of a snack machine while we waited for the next train back to Kanazawa.

As we had arrived back early, Sally was keen to visit the so-caled ninja temple and either book to visit it in a day or two, or visit it there and then. We turned up and Sally talked for a minute into the intercom to see if she could book. It transpired she didn't have to book, so we wandered in.

The main amusement of the visit is that Sally had no memory of visiting it in 2009. I remembered - dimly - but my memory sufficiently jammed with a visit to a similar temple full of golden statues that we did in 2003, I think, so it wasn't until later that I quizzed her about it. Sally was adamant we'd never been, but I was able to clear it up with her cousin William when we saw him later in Tokyo. I invite the reader to consider that if our memories are hazy about visiting something called a ninja temple that maybe we've spent too much time in Japan...

The Ninja temple isn't related to ninjitsu at all, actually, but while the temple's signage is at pains to explain this, they still refer to it as such, because the word Ninja is good for marketing.

The reason the Ninja moniker is associated with the temple is that when it contains a lot of secret rooms and passages to provide the local Lord who built it with security and privacy. There was even a trap or two to deal with would-be assassins. It strikes me that life for Japanese elites a few hundred years back must have been a rather precarious.

More intriguing than the temple was its booking system. As mentioned you could only book via phone, three days in advance. Why? For no good reason I can discern. Also tours were conducted solely in Japanese, though we were provided with booklets in English so we could read the explanations as we went.

Cosmically speaking this wasn't a terrible hassle, and the eccentricity of it was certainly entertaining and very Japanese. But I was struck at how unnecessary it was. An online booking system could provide some certainty about numbers well in advance (and allow bookings to be shifted with automatic notifications if required). Some tours could be reserved for tourists and provided in English or other languages as well, so that non Japanese speakers did end up with an inferior experience. I don't think this would be unreasonable. It just seems odd to me - what with the Japanese mentality emphasising demonstrating consideration for others - that the whole setup for the temple seemed rather thoughtless.

After the temple we caught a bus to a shopping mall to buy a suitcase. This was always part of the plan - to travel light for the bulk of the JR pass period, then buy a suitcase and fill it up with souvenirs/toys/clothes once we hit Kanazawa. We procured the item - after much deliberation - at another Don Quixote shop. We then ate at McDonalds (again!) in the complex. Finally we caught the bus back to the hotel. It had ended up being rather a long day, and a bit ho hum.

# December 27

After two days of going on sub-par side trips, I was getting a bit fed up. The plan for today was to visit the Fossa Magna Museum at Itoigawa Geopark. Now I'm a fan of geology, but after two days of sub-par side trip I was fearful that this trip was also going to be a bust. The day, just like most of the previous 12, was grey and bleak. We caught an earlyish train (E7) out to Itoigawa on the coast. A short busride in a very small bus later, and we were there.

Fossa Magna of course means (very informally) "big crack" in latin. In this case it refers to a rift lowland in the middle of Honshu where two halves separated, with the rift partially  for volcanoes to sprout up in the middle and fill in the gap. Itoigawa marks the boundary of two continental plates.

The museum reflected on this, and the work of Heinrich Edmund Naumann, who discovered the fossa in the 19th Century. Additionally a giant video screens showing the evolution of the earth from its formation to today, with continents whipping around. There were also a collection of fossils from the area, and a large collection of minerals and crystals and meteorites. Also, we had the museum almost entirely to ourselves. The combination of all of the above was immensely pleasurable. It was third day lucky.

After the museum we visited the nearby museum of Jomon people, the peoples of prehistoric Japan spanning from 15000 to 500BC. Itoigawa has extensive archaeological remains over many thousands of years, and the museum has lots of items to display. Most notable were some fine examples of the so-called Jomon pottery, which features intricate extrusions from their rims, making them look like hallucinagenic sand castles. These pots were gud from the remains of a 5000ish year-old village, on the general site of the museum. I was later moved to read the Wikipedia article, and ponder the origins of the Jomon people, or whether, over so many thousands of years of history, whether they were one or many peoples.

We came back to Kanazawa and wandered around the fish market. We ate some fairly average fried oysters, and then ate a shashimi set at a cramped restaurant. Tasted good.

# December 28

Today was a Kanazawa-only day. It started out fairly promisingly with sunshine, which we hadn't seen for quite a few days. We walked in the general direction of Kanazawa castle, ambling gingerly through half-melted slush. Angus would periodically pick up snow and lob it at us.

Our first stop was D.T. Suzuki museum. This fellow helped popularise Zen Buddhism in the West in the first half of the 20th Century. The Museum itself was fairly brief, outlining Suzuki's life and works. The museum's exterior, with its large pool and garden designed for Zen reflection, was the real star. I'm not sure Gus was really feeling the Zen, but in the breakout area of the museum he seemed to enjoy reading a kids book speculating about the identity of an apple.

Our next stop was the Museum of 21st Century Art. Our two previous visits had been delights, the chiefest of which is an installation consisting of a swimming pool with a glass later beneath the surface water, people can freely wander around, looking up at water, while from above you can see people walking about "under" the water. A gently surreal experience.

The day we visited the museum the Japanese New Year holiday had kicked in, and it was busy. Amid the chaos we discovered that you now had to pay extra to visit the pool, which caused Sally severe disgruntlement. We turned instead to the temporary exhibitions. The first we saw was a collection of works by artists across various islands in the Western Pacific, from Japan to the Philippines to Singapore and Malaysia. The uniting theme of the works seemed to be capitalism displacing local ethnic identity. I've come to loathe "commentary on the excesses of capitalism and consumerism", because, although it's not wrong to critique either capitalism or consumerism, I've just seen so much of it in the past decade I'm not interested.

Luckily then, that the other exhibition was on Yves Klein, the French visionary who became obsessed with Blue and esoteric ideas about colour transscendence. Here was a "true" artist doing bonkers things (Angus was particularly amused by the penises on various blue nude sculptures). Was his work political? Probably, but you don't need to know Klein's politics to get the point, which you had to in the other exhibition.

Although for me Klein redeemed our visit to the museum, things took another downward turn when we picked up our bags from the locker and found a bottle had leaked out of the locker and onto the floor. We confessed to a museum attendant, and we spent some awkward minutes cleaning up our mess with her. She was nice about it, but man she must have found us a pain.

Feeling a bit defeated, we returned to the hotel. Rain had set in, and we didn't feel up to visiting the Kanazawa Castle gardens, so Gus and I watched Disney Plus in our hotel room while Sally went out and did some window shopping. I think Gus enjoyed - I certainly did - the time off sightseeing, and I imagine Sally enjoyed the time on her own without our moaning.

In the evening we visited a buffet restaurant in Kanazawa. A bit like the Ninja Temple, Sally had forgotten we'd visited this restaurant before, this time in 2019. I was feeling a bit consitpated and uncomfortable, and didn't enjoy it much.

This was the extent of our time in Kanazawa. It was quite a contrast to our previous (spring time) visits. The magic wasn't there this time round. Aside from the Magna Fossa museum, the Kanazawa leg of the trip was the least enjoyable.

# December 29

We got up, bade an emotional farewell to the velociraptors, caught a bus to Kanazawa station, and caught an E7 train to Nagano. From Nagano we caught a further train to Yudanaka. This was a odd looking, tourist centric number, that squeaked and squarked as it went. The terrain was getting hillier as we went deeper into the Japanese alps, and snowfall was heavier, with less melt. We arrived in Yudanaka mid afternoon. Our reason for visiting was to see the snow monkeys, a group of Japanese macaques who in Winter months like to bathe in hot pools.

Our hotel was a Ryokan, a traditional Japanese guest house. Backpackers like to rave about experiencing authentic Japanese hospitality. We came in and found the standard Ryokan host, a superannuated individual (in this case a man) who manages check in in an idiosyncratic manner. His idiosyncracy was not to ask to photocopy our passports, the only Japanese hotelier not to do so. This Ryokan didn't have an elevator and we had to carry our gear up four floors. I saw it as exercise, so that wasn't a problem, but we were required to wear generic slippers once we got through the front door, and they frequently fell off as I ascended the stairs. Bit of a health and safety hazard, really.

The hotal offered the option of a family onsen, which was the only way I was going to do onsenning - ie not parading my bits in a pool with equally naked Japanese men. Our host (lets call him Basil) took us down the road and down a path into a secret area with a hot pool just for ourselves. We only had 40 minutes, which was enough. The water was a bit too hot for my liking, and I spent my time sitting in the water, getting too hot, standing up, getting too cold in near zero temperatures, and plonking myself back in the water. Angus babbled with exitement at the novelty, and kept dropping his togs, I guess to be more authentically Japanese. Sally was deeply impressed that this was a genuinely private onsen session, and kept telling us how special this was. It was certainly memorable gently boiling and looking out over the valley as the sun set.

We returned to our room and settled in for the night. The room was standard Ryokan-fare: thin mattresses over tatami mats, with lots of sliding screens to cause confusion. The toilet was separated from the sink and bath by the rest of the room, which was a bit odd, but bearable. , but once you've stayed in a few you start to yearn for double glazing. 

# December 30

The night at the Ryokan was fairly unsatisfactory; the walls were thin and the Westerners who came in at 12:40 AM were very loud. After a protracted bout of laughing Sally gave the wall a thump and they quietened down.

I awakened feeling surly. Breakfast, however, turned out to be a delight: buffet, yes, but the options were toast and cornflakes. Even more endearingly, we were serenaded by a player piano churning out waltz music and Herman's Hermits. One wall was given over toa display of covers of 60s era singles. Lots of Beatles, Japanese pop groups, and - with admirable randomness - a number by the Ohio Players. Finally, there was a behemoth of a jukebox against one wall. It wasn't powered up, and it probably wasn't power-uppable, but it remained a formidable presence in the room.

I guess this is the real value of a Ryokan - not so much the tatami mats, or the flimsy walls, or the slippers only for use in the toilet(?!), but the quirky idiosyncracy of Mom and Pop hotel management.

At 8:50 Basil drove us up the hill to the Monkey Park. From the entrance we walked about 2km through a pine forest. A small amount of snow fell as we went, with much more heaped on the ground. The atmosphere felt fairy tale Winter - not many tourists around at that point, so we had a chance to enjoy it.

We arrived at the Monkey Park proper, which turned out to be a private onsen with a bit on the end that the monkeys could go in, and tourists could photograph. Unlike in Kyoto, we only had to stay 1m from the apes, and there were no admonishments not to stare them in the eye. The main difference with Kyoto is there was no opportunity to feed the macaques, and I think this made the equation simpler: to the monkeys we were just sources of noise, and moving obstacles, but otherwise of little interest.

In the bath, the monkeys were nothing but cute, while about the general area dozens of monkeys were foraging in the snow for very little - I saw one macaque gamely nibbling on a twig, which didn't look nutritionally convincing, to be honest. That said, having consumed almost no dietary fibre in two weeks, I was feeling a bit envious.

Elsewhere on the primate behavioural front, there was regular scuffles between animals - presumably hierarchy enforcement, although it looked like bullying. There was one protracted piece of harrassment that looked to my eye a bit Me Too. I was later heartened to spot a couple of macacques perched high on an avalanche fence by turns copulating and grooming. That looked consensual, altough the female appeared to be the one doing the grooming.

After that, another 2km walk back, a 50 minute wait for a bus, a 10 minute bus ride, lunch, a trudge up the hill to retrieve gear and return borrowed snow boots, and have our picture taken by Baz. Then a trudge down the hill to the station, a one hour train back to Nagano, an hour wandering around Nagano station to buy food for the train to Tokyo, an hour and a half on the train to Tokyo. Our hotel was a few blocks away from Tokyo station. Called Remm, it was pretty nice, albeit without the character of our Yudanaka digs.

# December 31

In the morning we went to TeamLab Planet, a large art museum of multimedia exhibits. At the start there was a lot of lining up. Shuffled indoors, we were told we had to take our shoes and socks off (I hope they regularly applied fungicide everywhere) and roll up our trousers above our knees. Skirted people were told that there were rooms with mirrored floors where others would be able to see up their skirts and did they want to wear shorts. It all felt slightly confronting.

Initially we wandered barefoot on a spikey surface, and then through a room the flooring sagged to our knees when stepped onto the surface. It was fun at first to flop about and find the "ground" yielded to us, but we quickly found that getting up again required a bit of effort as the shifting surface gave no leverage. Eventually the epxerience turned into a minor ordeal, as we needed cardiovascular exertion to haul ourselves out of the room.

As I remember it, the next stop was a large room of mirrors with a dense thicket of LED vines trailing from the ceiling. These vines osciallated blinken colours to present motion, and the kaleidoscopic nature of it was entrancing.

Another room was knee deep in milky-coloured water and had moving fish projected onto it. This room gave me a bit of trouble because my skinny Jeans West jeans didn't roll over the knee, so the bottom of my trews quickly became wet. Not that I was too bothered - it'd quickly dry off against my skin - but because attendants noticed and quickly swooped in to offer me shorts to wear. I had to say, on three separate occasions, that I was ok. It was another example of Japanese consideration being a bit overbearing for me.

A further room featured a mirrored floor with a ceiling which had projected upon it a space filled with dancing flowers. We were invited to lie on the floor and just stare. I think this was my favourite room because I wasn't soaked or struggling and or heavily selfied and I could just absorb what I was feeling.

In that room I came to the conclusion that TeamLabs Planet, for all its 21st Century digital dazzle, was just a little bit boring. The soothing new age tones piped through hidden speakers in each room provided the subliminal message that everything was safe, and nothing would hurt you. The nearest I got to an interesting experience was struggling through the room without a solid floor. The fish room and the flower room were merely pretty, and the LED and infinity mirror room was about the third or fourth I've been in in the past decade, and the only thing notable about it was its scale. It would have been good to witness something just a shade weirder, something like the psychedelic freakout boat ride in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Not _too_ much of a freakout, of course - I wouldn't like that. Hell, I'd even have preferred an multimedia work that comments on the evils of capitalism and/or consumerism, over an experience that summed to be merely, blandly, _nice_. Perhaps I'm being unfair. It's just as a kid I thought the 21st Century would be cooler.

We stumbled out into the TeamLab Planet's locker room, reaffixed our shoes and socks (we were given towels to dry our feet with; I appreciated that) and went on our way.

Ginza 6, Tsutaya Books Ginza, Uniqlo, Lotte burger for lunch

In the afternoon we caught the train out to Yokohama to view the life-size, reasonable mobile Gundam. What's a Gundam? Well, it's an angsty-teen-piloting-a-giant-robot-of-war anime series (see also Neon Genesis Evangelion, and also a billion others). I can't say I'm not a fan - I enjoyed watching the first Gundam TV show because - not despite - it being incredibly dated (1979, baby!), but my interest was severely blunted during my first covid lockdown where Gus and I built a Gundam robot set that Sally had picked up (not entirely in accordance with my wishes) at the Crofton Downs School fair one year. Building a model robot with a five year old inevitably means building it yourself, and the damn thing took me three weekends to build, and after each session my eyes would focus and my back hurt from being hunched over a table from hours on end. Nevertheless I was interested in seeing a "life size" (18 metre!) motorised Gundam.

We emerged from Yokohama station and rolled out to the shore ot see the robot in the distance. Through the turnstiles we were each given a Gundam model - oh no! (I thought grimly to myself, that it would probably be me who had to build all three of them.) Just inside entrance was a wall displaying a message from Tomino, the creator of Gundam. It was an apology that the robot didn't move more, essentially conveying that while the robot's engineers had hoped they could achieved more, this was the best that could be done with current technology. I began The robot itself was looking majestic, glowing in the late afternoon sun. Aside from this the first thing 



# January 1

Happy new year! The main excitement of today was 

















# Overall thoughts

I've spent much of this account grumbling, and I'd have to say that the trip was a mixed bag. Sally loves to organise holidays, and this one was a tour de force. However in 19 days we stayed at 10 hotels, which I think gives an idea of the amount of moving around we had to do. To put it positively, we used the hell out of our JR passes, but the net effect has been rather more time spent on buses and trains than actually sight-seeing.

The wintry conditions have been a bit of a struggle. Seeing snow falling in Hiroshima was wonderful, but scrabbling along slush in Kanazawa was a pain. The low humidity of the heated environments we travelled and stayed in made our hands dry. Meanwhile, in sub 10 degree temperatures the outdoors was never conventionally pleasant, so it was like defacto constant rain. Having to wear heavy winter clothing constantly was crucial outdoors, but in overly heated indoors environments was also a liability.

To be fair, I enjoyed everywhere we went that I hadn't been to before: Naoshima, Kurashiki, Hiroshima, and Yudanaka, but revisiting Kyoto and Kanazawa didn't do much for me this time around, and Tokyo has always been a bit of a trial for me.

All this is leaving me feeling a bit done with Japan. I guess that's understandable after 6 visits, but it's left me worried because Sally's keen for similar December/January jaunts to Europe and North America in the next few years, and I don't want these to feel as much of a slog as this holiday has.

What could we do differently? We spent 13 nights in Tokyo, Kyoto, and Kanazawa, and I think it would have been good to perhaps limit Kyoto to two nights and Kanazawa altogether. Another night in Hiroshima would be good. Making the Tokyo nights contiguous, rather than start and end would also have been better.
