title: Cricket!

I played cricket as a kid for three seasons in the early 80s. Saturday morning, white shirt, white shorts, smell of cut grass, lovely... And I enjoyed it. It all ended when I graduated to hard ball cricket and having to contend with other kids menacing me with hard projectiles. Now 9 and 10 year olds aren't routinely bouncing throat-high balls at you, but they were capable of perilously high full tosses. What's more, helmets weren't provided, so while I'll freely concede my timidity, it's not like there wasn't risk.

More than the fear of being sconed by a beamer, I disliked the increasing amount of aggression between kids. I was a sensitive child, and found gamesmanship sort of stupid, really. _Unnecessary_. While rugby might be physical torture, cricket was psychological torture too. Although I stopped playing, I've learned to appreciate those who manage to thrive at such a brutal sport.

I still continued to love watching cricket though. My viewing career started in the summer of 1982/83, when I was old enough to stay up and watch the baseball-aping and equally inaccurately named "World Series" Cup competition, played each summer in Australia. Over there a revolution had taken place in the late 70s after the frog-like media mogul Kerry Packer enacted a hostile takeover on the sport and injected colourful uniforms and technical innovations like playing under lights and displaying an amusing animation of an angry duck whenever anyone got out without scoring.

New Zealand played in the 1982/83 WSC competition, along with Australia (naturally) and England. The climax of the previous competition in which NZ had been involved (1980/81) had been marred by the infamous Underarm Incident, so interest was high.

The enduring thing I liked about the WSC was the uniforms. It seems hilarious to admit it now, but I was obsessed with the New Zealand beige and brown uniform. It was already an Age of Beige - see also: the uniforms in Battlestar Galactica - but this uniform made it ultracool to me. In the early 2000s these colours had a renaissance when adopted by the "Beige Brigade" NZ cricket fan club, so I know other Gen Xers were as entranced by those uniforms as I was.

I don't want to linger too much on uniforms, but it's worth pointing out how marvellous they really were. Firstly, they were made in simple combinations of two colours, without elaborate designs or sponsor's logos. Second, the trousers still had a bit of a flare at the cuffs, which made them pretty groovy (and often they sported a marvellous crease!). Flatteringly, slimming patches of darker colour were placed over the love handles of the shirts, cunningly the less sculptured physiques of 80s athletes. Colourwise, it wasn't just the NZ uniforms that looked good. The English two-tone blue was classy, while the Pakistani green and dark blue, and the Sri Lankan dark blue and yellow were startling. The crowning glory though was the West Indian uniform: mauve and a lavender grey. More on this later!

So it's 1983 and we're watching live TV of Australia, two hours behind us, playing cricket at night. I'm watching in a dressing gown. There are big crowds - people had less to do in those days - so the noise is exciting. Then there's the Australian commentary team of Kerry Packer's Channel Nine. The commentators ranged from the slightly buffoonish Bill Lawry and Tony Greig, through the vaguely sullen Ian Chappell through to Richie Benaud, the gold standard in cricket commentary for more than 40 years. He's the commentary equivalent of a gin and tonic. These giants of... explaining what's happening (or, failing that, making shit up) were so memorable they were lampooned to great comic effect by The 12th Man.

What of the cricket? Well, following the New Zealand cricket team in the 80s was a bit of a rollercoaster. Since the mid 70s the team had been on a gradually upward trajectory, winning with increasing frequency after decades of being perennial no-hopers. There team in 82/83 had two genuinely good players Richard Hadlee, Glenn Turner (Martyn Crowe would arrive the following season). But more compelling to me were the "character" journeymen with a bit of personality, one of whom was always guaranteed to put in a decent performance each game: Lance Cairns was strong as an ox and deaf as a post, wielder of a very heavy bat called excalibur, and able to wallop sixes at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (the world's biggest) with ease. Ewen Chatfield, a precise if not particularly threatening bowler, amusingly known as the "Naenae Express". His chief charm was his uniquely unskilled batting, so bad every time he managed to face a ball without getting out onlookers would cheer. Then there was lanky Jeremy Coney, an indifferent batter and bowler of slow rubbish who seemed there more for his personality than anything else.

This was not a team that seemed particularly promising, but it was capable of clawing victory from the jaws of defeat. And so it was in the 1982/83 WSC. NZ got into the finals ahead of the much classier English team. They lost 2-0 in the finals but Cairns hit six sixes in the second final (relatively common now, but back then completely outlandish), managing (sort of) to dredge some pride back from defeat.

The 80s progressed with me glued to the screen whenever the NZ team played. There were numerous highlights but the chief triumphs were defeating England and Australia in away test series. The Australian victories were particularly sweet, although I later learned that the Australian side was heavily depleted because of a rebel tour to South Africa.

The golden age for NZ cricket ended gradually in the late 80s as the tinnier players (Cairns, Coney, Chatfield) retired and were replaced with lesser "talent". Hadlee and Martin Crowe were the true class players in the team, and after Hadlee retired without a strong successor (sorry Danny Morrison!) the team started to decline. By the early 90s the test team were at the mercy of just about everyone, with Pakistan's Wasim and Waqar in particular helping themselves to plenty of wickets. The 1992 world cup on local soil allowed one last tilt at greatness (cruelly thwarted by an unfancied Pakistan in the semi final) and the team faded into mediocrity in the mid 90s.

NZ cricket entered a wilderness for approximately 20 years. There were always players in the team capable of pulling off remarkable feats, it's just the frequency of them was insufficient to allow the team to win with any consistency. Injury was also a problem (I'm heartbroken Shane Bond didn't get more of a go). So there were brief periods of greatness (including some very competitive series against the aussies in the early 2000s followed by a lot of rubbish. The decline coincided with cricket not being broadcast on terrestrial TV, so I could only watch when I visited my parents. Inevitably I gave up following.

The nadir came in the late 2000s when batting stocks were so low and coaching so lamentable that spinning wunderkind Dan Vettori was simultaneously the best bowler and batter, as well as effectively being team coach. It's a shame that he and long-time almost great but not quite there batsman-captain Stephen Fleming were stranded with a team of largely no-hopers.

Well, it all changed in the early 2010s when the team found itself with half a dozen decent players: bowlers Southee and Boult, opener Latham, batsman Ross Taylor, wicketkeeper BJ Watling, captain and slogger McCullum, and, jewel in the crown, Kane Williamson.

I'm in love with Kane. He's what New Zealand's needed since Martin Crowe retired. He's not as graceful to watch as Crowe, but he's more careful and disciplined - the D word being the perennial quality New Zealand batsmen have lacked.

From 2014 to 2021 the NZ team were, if not formidable, then deserving of respect. Brendon McCullum was a player of the earlier crappier era, but he led with total commitment and was instrumental in engineering the new golden age. Ross Taylor would have been the standout batsman of any NZ era who had the misfortune to be largely overshadowed by Williamson. The bowlers were solid without quite making the level of greatness. Compared to the 80s NZ team the 10s one had more assured talent, if less personality - save for the lion-hearted bruiser Neil Wagner, instrumental in so many victories.

The crowning glory for New Zealand was winning the inaugural test trophy, as well as coming runner up at the 2015 and 2019 world cups (the 2019 loss being so close that I don't think I'll ever recover from it). Yet there were still some missed opportunities. The team didn't manage to defeat Australia in a test (in fact, the most recent victory was an improbable one in 2010 in Australia). South Africa consistently had the wood on NZ too (except in world cups...). Still it's an era with many happy memories.

When the current crop of greats retires, are we doomed to a new dark age? Yeah probably.


You get the odd bloke like Shane Warne, who had enough charm for you to love him even though he was a larrikin. Types like the phlegmatic Alan Border and Steve Waugh you could at least respect. But then you get arseholes like Ponting or Michael Clarke, or boofheads like David Warner. On the fast bowling side things aren't much better: there's the legendary hard men like Lillee and Thompson, the unlovely spiv Jeff Lawson, the frankly mean Glenn McGrath, the preposterous Mitchell Johnson.

The Australian team is often characterised as cheaters, and no little amount of wealth
