I love a good documentary. Here's a survey of the greats.

# Civilisation (1969)

It all starts with that Alpha and Omega of TV documentaries, David Attenborough. He started his televisual career in the 50s and 60s as a naturalist filming the now-dubious practice of visiting far flung tropical locales in to pinch wildlife specimens for chilly UK zoos. In the late 60s Attenborough was elevated to management at the BBC, becoming controller of the BBC2 channel, which catered to more elevated tastes. BBC2 was the first UK channel to transition to colour transmission, and Attenborough chose to commission a documentary series that would showcase colour. The subject? Why, the history of Western art, of course. The frontman he chose was one Kenneth Clark, a very Establishment art historian. (Another of Attenborough's "colour-conscious" commissioning choices: televised games of snooker!)

Civilisation is one of the last grand-scale expressions of confidence in Western Civilisation. (The title's lack of qualifier about which civilisation was being referred to is perhaps the biggest giveaway. Check your privilege, Clark!) The Marxist author John Berger was later afforded a three episode dissenting right of reply in the series Ways of Seeing (1972). Although Ways of Seeing is a bracing response to Civilisation, I rather feel the wider movement from the Left and Academia (same thing now, really) to downplay the achievements of Western Civilisation has been taken too far and become too corrosive to Western identity.

As for the Civilisation itself, it's most valuable as a document of its time. Clark's viewpoint is now so alien that it's fascinating to hear what he has to say, even if it feels overweening. The simple style of the series is also beautiful, and it looks great in HD.

# The Ascent of Man (1973)

As for things that are dated, the title of this documentary alone is a disgrace. Man?? Ascent?! You can almost hear the dayglo-haired harpies hissing. However Jacob Bronowsky charting of the development of science is to my mind the greatest documentary of all time. Very much a boffin, and presenting his material in a very academic manner, yet also completely gripping. The best episode is the one which covers the Holocaust, concluding with Bronowski at Auschwitz standing in a puddle of water mixed with human ashes, the denouncing the ideology and dogma that had exterminated (among very many others) his own relatives. Unfortunately Bronowski poured himself into the documentary, and died only a few months after the series was broadcast.

# The Age of Uncertainty (1977)

In which the economist J.K. Galbraith propels us through two hundred years of economic history. The documentary makers clearly thought the subject matter was going to be too abstract, and attempted to use elaborate studio sets to represent abstract concepts. The result feels like avant garde theatre.

What of Galbraith? He ranges through the subject matter with mordant wit, but I found it hard to keep up with him (that said I don't know much about economics, so that might have had something to do with it).  The tale he spun was one of exploitation. In fact, after watching this series, I'd venture to say that history is just one group of people being economically exploited after another. Was it good? Yes, I think so.

# Connections (1978)

This is one I first saw when I was about five. I didn't really understand what James Burke was talking about, but he seemed friendly enough, with his huge glasses and erratic hair. On much later viewing I discovered the series was "an alternative view of change", which eschewed presentation of science in its usual hindsight-oriented manner, and instead formulated it as an essentially random process where any particular innovation relied on contingencies of history. Though seeming to exhibit polymathic tendencies, his pedigree wasn't as blue ribbon as that of Clark or Bronowski. Instead, Burke had started as a journalist and ascended to presenting BBC science shows like Tomorrow's World and the anchoring BBC coverage of the moon landings. Nevertheless, his view of history as heavily contingent and bordering on chaotic is one borne out he entertainingly demonstrates at breakneck pace. One memorable highlight has Burke demonstrating the brutality of mediaeval warfare by taking to a pig carcass with a broadsword. Perhaps his finest moment though, is when he film the end of an episode at the space coast in Florida, stating his conclusion and then wheeling around and pointing as Titan III rocket launches behind him. (I discovered later that this was the launch of the very historic Voyager 2 mission.)

That said Burke does tend to come across as a bit smug and clevercloggsy, not least at the start of the first episode where, in the dead of night, he skulks about the plaza of the World Trade Centre, wearing a trenchcoat, and assailing the viewer with a bewildering barrage of questions. It's not the most welcoming or reassuring way to start a documentary series. That said, the premise he was trying to communicate (that we live in a very delicate interconnected web that requires everything to be working to function) is excellent.

Connections' conclusion is equally pugnacious. Burke asserts that art hasn't done anything near as much as science and technology to elevate human life. I'm not sure if this snook cocking was directly aimed at the likes of Kenneth Clark, but the idea is irresistable. Engaging with his argument, though, I can't say that a washing machine (miracle though it is) is nearly as inspiring as a Mozart symphony. To me technology solves the question of how to exist, while art (as well as religion in former and perhaps future times) addresses the why.

# Life on Earth (1979)

I don't think I watched this as a kid, but I remember both my mother and grandparents had copies of the book tie-in. David Attenborough is now famous as a gentle and very ancient naturalist mumbling very slowly at camera or into microphone about the goings on of the natural world, but back in 1979 he was a sprightly 53, and his flared pants, big collared shirts, and (occasionally) safari suits give off the faintest whiff of disco on the Serengeti.

The content itself is very spare. What I love about 70s documentaries is that the music is not the sort of pompous, bombastic synth orchestrations you get these days, but a much more chromatic chamber music pieces. Just much classier, you know? As for the content, well it's obviously 1970s state of the art. The story is much more complete today, but the broader picture portrayed on Life on Earth is still reasonably accurate. What I like most is that although it tells the story of the _history_ of life on earth, the words are illustrated with footage of existing animals or plants that have retained the relevant traits of their ancestors. This gives a sense of grounding that you can't get when your documentary is comprised entirely of CG.

After the success of Life on Earth, Attenborough has spent the next 45 years repeating the same formula, examining the natural world from a myriad of perspectives. One thing that's remained constant is the man's absolute integrity. What a champ!

(If you're looking for an example of a well-lived life, Attenborough's wikipedia entry, documenting a 75ish year career, is an astonishing read.)

# Cosmos (1980)

Carl Sagan's cosmic voyage is perhaps the most famous of any of the series I've mentioned here (certainly in the US), but once you've seen The Ascent of Man you realise Cosmos is just that series retooled for American audiences, even down to Ascent of Man director Adrian Malone also directing Cosmos. This is not to downplay Cosmos' achievement, however. Having framed Cosmos thus I should say that Sagan is an absolutely superb science communicator and Cosmos deserves its status. Bullions and bullions.

Again, the series is informed by music, though in quite a different way to Life on Earth. Several works by Vangelis are featured, including the theme music (Heaven and Hell part 1), which sets the mood of the series perfectly. Bombastic, yes, but suitably cosmic. When it got to NZ in the mid 80s I was too young to really get into it, and I never watched it properly until my late 30s, when episodes were available wholly unlegally on YouTube.

Right then; so: Cosmos vs The Ascent of Man? Well, I think it's Bronowski by a nose. But really, both are brilliant.

# The Shock of the New (1980)

Another anti-Clark viewpoint (that guy can't seem to catch a break), this time covering the history of modern art, is presented by Australian critic Robert Hughes, who comes across a bit partician like Kenneth Clark, while having a sensibility closer to John Berger. The series is brilliant, but marks for me the end of the era of grand documentary series. It's not that serious documenting didn't keep happening, it's just that the scale changed: the blockbuster era had ended. Attenborough may have continued to make his series on a reasonably large scale, but to a large degree the main attraction of these shows is the improvements in camera technology, and the fact that Attenborough himself is so beloved. There's nothing quite as incisive about them as the original Life on Earth and its peers.

# Others unseen

The great and ancient correspondent Alastair Cooke did a series called Alastair Cooke's America, which I haven't seen but I suspect is another Great Documentary. There's also a series called The Age of Uncertainty (also directed by Adrian Malone) presented by the economist John Kenneth Galbraith that also seems worth checking out. And there's Ken Burns' highly regarded The Civil War (1990).

# Conclusion

Attenborough's aspiration for Civilisation was that a layperson viewer could come away from the 13 episodes with a decent overview of the history of Western art since the dark ages. The Ascent of Man and Cosmos had similar aspiration to teach the fundamentals of science, and Life on Earth did the same for biology. To me these documentaries are the highest achievement of public broadcasting.

By the 1980s, the Reithian ideal of public broadcasting as a medium for elevating the intellectual life of the common (hu)man fell out of favour both with the anti-elitist right (think Rupert Murdoch) and the postmodern left (all social science academics). In America the change was less stark as public broadcasting was more subscription funded, which makes the output paradoxically both more secure (less influence from capricious governmental interference) but often with fewer resources than the BBC could (or at least was prepared to) commit.

There is something of a case to answer that the documentarians I've surveyed are unrelentingly white and male. There's no reason you couldn't make series like this today with any desirable combination of skin tone and genitals, but the expense of such an projects of such scope (up to 13 one hour episodes) is probably too great to be feasible. I was trying to think of a female equivalent of Bronowski or Attenborough and could only come up the satirical character Philomena Cunk (played by comedienne Diane Morgan), who parodied this sort of documentary series in such shows as Cunk on Britain, and Cunk on Earth, clearly a reference to Life on Earth. (For what it's worth, Cunk co-creator Charlie Brooker is has praised Bronowski and The Ascent of Man, so the parody is probably affectionate.)
