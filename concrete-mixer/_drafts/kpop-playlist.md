I used to have a post here about BlackPink and K/DA, which was a very specific and idiosyncratic focus on K-pop. Since then I've compiled another Spotify playlist of the Kpop tracks I like, and I'm going to run through them.

# My history with things K

Very briefly my wife and I started watching K dramas in the late 2000s, and K variety shows in the early 2010s. I was finally turned on to Kpop with a combination of seeing groups in variety shows, and the cosmic enormity of Gangnam Style in 2012.

My interest in Kpop peaked around 2014/2015, and fell away as the neverending drama of scandals, (literal) car crashes and suicides left me feeling the enterprise was exploitative, and by taking an interest I was (very very slightly) complicit in it. In 2022 I returned to the K world after hearing songs I liked in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Miku Miku Dance videos. I ended up interested in Western-gaming-company-manufactured-virtual-act K/DA, and the more straight-forward Kpop girl group Black Pink.

This playlist is very idiosyncratic. There's no ballads, cutesy "oppa oppa" numbers, and Bobby Brown/New Jack Swing-esque boy band numbers (Korean producers really love their New Jack Swing; 1988 forever!). With few exceptions I prefer girl group songs to those of boy groups. This would superficially seem a bit pervy, but I tend to find boy band songs boring. I think this is because these songs are intended as frameworks upon which young males can look good and demonstrate reproductive fitness in an unthreatening way. Girl groups by contrast, need to work to maintain their fans attention, so their music is more camp and theatrical, a bit like diva disco. So basically I'm like a gay man whooping to Gloria Gaynor.


# The list

## f(x) - Butterfly

A non-single featuring FILL IN HERE

## Aespa - Dreams Come True (2022?)

This was a originally 1998? song by S.E.S, here covered by fellow SM Entertainment Group collective Aespa. Comparing the production of the original and sequel (both in audio and video) highlights big changes over two decades. The original Dreams Come True is relatively relaxed romp with a Soul II Soul beat (pretty dated even in the late 90s). Meanwhle the Aespa version is slick and hyper-produced. The videos are even more instructive: S.E.S.'s members look like plausible human beings, while the five surgically scultped members of Aespa only have three faces between them (and those borrowed from stable mates SNSD.) 

The song itself isn't particularly remarkable. What tips it over the edge are some curious lyrics:

Yes you feel me good
do you want to up and down
yeah you feel me good
do you want to upside down?

... which I think is meant to suggest falling head over heels in love, but sounds more like a sex act.

## Aespa - I'll Make You Cry (2022?)

A non-single featuring a nice bit of acid synth.

## Pink Venom

To my mind Black Pink are the pinnacle of girl group Kpop. To me they epitomise what I like in the genre. Their production sound is heavily electronic. The group members complement each other well: Jennie raps, Lisa raps and dances, Rose has a compelling set of pipes, and the group's Zeppo - Jisoo - is, well, there. (If I'm ever murdered it'll be Jisoo stans whatdunnit.)

The first few times I heard Pink Venom I didn't think it was up to much (a bit too similar to previous songs, was my initial verdict?), but by listen number ten I was hooked. It's funny how some songs can drill into your brain.
