Oh, The Cure. I first heard them at the time the remix album Mixed Up came out. I remember hearing the 12" version of Fascination Street while playing Talisman(!) with friends, and being absolutely astonished. I had no musical reference point for it, and it just seemed amazing.

My early interest in The Cure was somewhat inhibited by several factors. First, I was avidly into classical music, and Jean Michel Jarre(?!), and rock seemed a bit down-market to me. Even setting snobbery aside, the group was pushed by people in my social circle whom I considered (at the time) to be enemies. Thankfully this pettiness didn't hinder me from finally shamefacedly borrowing albums. Otherwise, I'd have missed out on the Cure's many tear-streaked delights.

Although The Cure makes sense now as a mostly pop act with a few early, Difficult albums, to a desperately naive 15 year old everything of theirs sounded confronting, be it Faith or the highly commercial Head on the Door (I remember being spooked by the rather straightforward Kyoto Song). What this has meant is that all the songs are really vivid to me.

Here follows a commentary on select works by the group.

# Boys Don't Cry (1979)

This was a US compilation of the band's first LP Three Imaginary Boys, with adjacent singles lumped in and filler extracted, making for a superior listen. (Normaly US handling of UK originals are terrible - see Capitol's eyerolling handling of the Beatles' early work - but at least in this case it worked out well.) Sadly Boy's Don't Cry is no longer "in print" in the streaming world. I guess there are unofficial playlists out there though. My favourite songs are Fire in Cairo and Three Imaginary Boys. I used to find the scream at the end of Subway Song a bit hard to take. Ah, great stuff!

# 17 Seconds (1980)

The highlight is of course A Forest, but the other songs are bleakly, softly beautiful. In Your House and M, especially. I really like Mattieu Hartley's understated organ work: augments the songs nicely without getting carried away. I also like the tight, dry, spare, and claustrophobic sound on this album.

# Faith (1981)

Despite the fact it's miserable as all get-out, I quite like it. It's got a sort of languorous mood that one might experience during (say) voluntary exsanguination. "There's nothing left but faith!" wails Bob at the end. Seemed very intensely meaningful as a teenager, but these days I think come on lad, cheer up! Further notes: Love the double-tracked bass on Other Voices, the strumming guitar on The Drowning Man has a yearning force to it. My favourite song from the '80-'82 depression period though, is Charlotte Sometimes, nestled between Faith and Pornography. It has a genuinely Gotho music vid, too

# Pornography (1982)

The height of the group's having-a-bad-time-of-it phase, I find this hard to listen to now, not so much because of the nihilism, but because it's the sound of a group that's in a bad place psychologically.

# Japanese Whispers (1983)

An 8 song comp of singles and b sides from the group's period of (very welcome) pop reinvention; I have to confess that this slight and entirely label-contrived collection is my favourite Cure artefact. The singles are boppy, the b sides light and airy if occasionally melancholy (but never wallowy). My faves: La Ment and The Upstairs Room.

On that note what I like about Bob is that whatever songs he wrote at the time would just go out with the next release. No holding back for the next album. Just bang! there you go. Consequently the Cure's B sides collections have some surprisingly good entries.

# The Top (1984)

In 1983 The Cure was on life support, regularly releasing singles, but far from being a going concern. It didn't help that Smith was doing guitar duties with Siouxsie and the Banshees, as well as a side project with the Banshees' Steve Severin. Eventually Bob recommitted himself to the Cure, and The Top was the next project out the gate. The album shares the psychedelic mood of the Banshees' album Hyaena (which Smith also played on). It's a bit patchy, but the songs Piggy in the Mirror and Bananafishbones are all good fun.

# Head on the Door (1985)

The Top had been produced with a relatively skeleton crew, but for Head on the Door Smith built the band back up, readmitting former bassist Simon Gallup. This line up would remain in place (with the odd tweak; seeya Lol Tolhurst!) for the next four albums, the longest period of continuity the group experienced.

Head on the Door was arguably the most commercial album they did, with the disgustingly catchy Inbetween Days and Close to Me. My favourites are flamenco The Blood, the utterly 1985 Push, A Night Like This, and Screw.

# Disintegration (1989)

We're skipping over 1987's Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me, which features some good songs but which was a bit too long for its own good. On then to Disintegration, an album where Bob is moody over turning 30 and perhaps feeling his best was behind him (now he's in his 60s, I can't imagine how he must be feeling). Unlike with Pornography, where the emotional pain was a bit too raw, Disintegration is a more restrained and pleasant wallowing in melancholy. The first half of the album is more dynamic than the second, but it's a very full and satisfying bucket that is drawn out of the er, misery well. As a Romantic teenager this album was my favourite Cure outing; in middle age I think it's splendid, but I slightly disapprove of the self-indulgence.

# Wish (1992)

I remember the excitement when Wish came out, though in retrospect it's a fairly ho-hum record, sort of Cure-gone-grunge. Feels a bit twee now, esp songs like To Wish Impossible Things. The success of Friday I'm in Love was a bit of an "egad!" shock to my too-cool sort-of friends, but I thought it jolly enough. My favourite song from the period is the B side This Twilight Garden, melancholy pop reminiscent of the B sides compiled on Japanese Whispers. I'm pretty baffled the song didn't make it on to Wish, though perhaps Smith found it a bit old hat.

The Cure played a concert in my home town in mid 1992 and I almost could have gone, only my father forbade me because he feared I'd be beaten to death by gang members(?!). There was no convincing him how desperately off the mark that assessment was. Jeez Dad! Apparently the gig was amaaazing, but in adulthood I'm not too fussed, really. Ah, iss fine!

# Conclusion

Another four albums followed, but the band were in a creative decline. Even Bob seems to have given up writing songs, with the last album coming out in 2008. Good call. Touring continues, as well it might given the rich back catalogue to work with, and no shortage of fans keen to hear them.

As a teenager I was goth-adjacent, liking The Cure and Bauhaus, but not quite prepared to dye and back-comb. In retrospect, thank God! Even if goth style "wasn't for me", the music was more serious. 

Like Bauhaus, the Cure were never properly cool, and were even the subject of a moral panic in the late 80s in NZ when a rash of suicides were linked (fairly or not) with the band's music. But I think of the Cure as relatively cheery overall. I mean, it gets bleak at times, but after 1982 there's usually a spark of humour to put the _weltschmerz_ in its place. Other than providing me an generous supply of splendid 80s pop songs, in a way the Cure also taught me not to fear darkness.
