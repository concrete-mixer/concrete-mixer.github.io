This excursion takes me on a retrospective of my 12-ish and counting year journey through K-pop.

I'd like to say I got into K-pop before it was cool, but it's not just not so. I do want to stress that I _definitely_ got into K dramas and K variety shows before they were cool (I don't think that should really impress you, but I'm saying it anyway), but I ignored K pop until Gangnam style. Initially I was more drawn to variety emperor Yu Jae-Suk's cameo in the video more than the song, but as Gangnam Style rapidly became a global phenomenon I became entranced. I certainly played my part in getting the video to 1 YouTube billion views by the end of 2012.

My dalliance wth K pop might have ended there, but in late 2012 my work colleague Levon, having introduced me to Gangnam Style, turned me on to SNSD's Flower Power.

Backing up a bit, SNSD (or Girl's Generation to less refined folk) was the flagship 9(!)-piece combo run by K pop powerhouse SM Entertainment. Flower Power was a Japanese-language single. It's by no means a stand-out in the group's discography - their signature work is the rather sickly Gee - but it had qualities I greatly liked. The EDM production was glitzy, and the minor key and urgent feel of the track reminded me of the KLF's venerable warhorse What Time is Love?

Unfortunately none of SNSD's other singles had the same intensity (that said, I'm quite fond of Mr Taxi and Run Devil Run). Indeed it became quickly apparent to me that most K pop wasn't my cup of tea at all, and my earlier uninterest was, statistically, entirely justified. The boy groups tended produce non-threatening New Jack Swingish R&B, one notable exception being Big Bang's release Fantastic Baby (and also Big Bang leader G-Dragon's single One of a Kind). In comparison Girl groups tend to have more stylistic variety. Along with the R&B there's also a bit of EDM, hip hop, and what I'd describe as cute jazzy folksy study music. I think the explanation for this is that boy bands can get by more on handsomeness, whereas girl groups have to work more to get attention.

It's the EDM singles that I am primarily drawn to. An absolutely classic example is 2NE1's swaggering I Am the Best. (If you want to keep count, in the early 2010s 2NE1 was SNSD's main rival, give or take a Wondergirl or two)

So far I could only find one song per group, but that would change when I discovered f(x), younger stablemates of SNSD. This five piece group's major singles tended to be dance tracks, every one of them being a banger: NU ABO, Electric Shock, Rum Pum Pum Pum (featuring the band performing in Tartan, and lead singer Krystal even sporting a [Tam o' Shanter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tam_o%27_shanter_(cap))), and finally, perhaps the greatest of them all, the apocalyptic Red Light. 

Though not quite in the category of high drama EDM songs that I enjoyed most, I also discovered more irreverant groups like Crayon Pop (the loopy Bar Bar Bar being their chief triumph) and the tongue in cheek Orange Caramel, who produced the wry disco number Catallena and My Copycat, with a video featuring spot-the-difference and Where's Wally gimmicks. My Copycat's arrangment feels very close to [We No Speak Americano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E9Ed9DUQoQ), which makes me wonder if the title is an acknowledgement of it's own derivativeness. (Alternatively, there's a whole genre of house beats over mid century latin jazzwith, so it's hard to say.) In any event this video the group performing [Catallena](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKU1oA7TxUM) with drinks on their heads gives a good idea of what they were about.

Around 2016 my interest in K things petered away. 2NE1 imploded when one of their members had a very minor drugs scandal, and f(x), SNSD, and Orange Caramel all declined. As well as hearing less music I liked, I was learning more pointless controversies (one example I can remember is elfin singer IU being accused of paedophilia over an ESOL comment she made about her adimirably psychedelic song Zeze). (It struck me at the time that South Korean "netizens" were the most judgemental people in the universe; little did I know that Western social media would also become this way as the decade "progressed".)

More than any of this nonsense though I learned more about the exploitativeness of the K pop industry, and I felt that my interest-taking, no matter how peripheral, made me complicit. This decision was only reinforced by the later Black Sun scandal that undid Big Bang, and the profoundly saddening 2019 suicides of Goo Hara of Kara and Sulli of f(x).

But I was brought back to the K pop fold in early 2022 by JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. Now the connection might not seem obvious (even if you know that practically everything is a "JoJo reference"), so let me explain: there's a piece of Japanese software called Miku Miku Dance, which allows you to choreograph animated dancers. On my obsessively regular trawls of YouTube for mindless JoJo content (when I could have been reading War and Peace!), I found numerous videos of JoJo characters dancing to K pop songs. (Why do these exist? I don't know; ask the videos' creators.) Through watching these I got exposed to a new generation of K pop groups without actually having to look them up.

The first songs that turned me back on to K pop weren't entirely K pop. K/DA were a manufactured group comprised of characters from the video game League of Legions (very popular in South Korea, it makes a sort of sense, believe me). The virtual group were also a sort of super group with singing duties performed by members of the Korean band G-Idle along with US and Chinese singers.

The history of animated pop groups isn't replete with artistic triumphs. There's the Archies' Sugar Sugar, and Do the Bart Man. (There's also Gorillaz, but I don't know if I'd call them pop.) K/DA's first single, 2018's POP/STARS, was pretty good. The group (or, should I say, League of Legends publisher Riot Games) followed up with a second single, More, in 2020, along with (in classic K pop style) a "mini album" called All Out. More is a better song than POP/STARs, I think, though I like the visual style of the video a good deal less.

I also discovered K pop superstars Black Pink. They were just getting started when I faded out of K pop in 2016, being YG's successor group to 2NE1. A bit like f(x), Black Pink have had a wonderful run of hard EDM singles. My favourite is Ddu Ddu Du, but there's a lot of other bangers, like How You Like That, Kill This Love, and Pink Venom. Even quieter songs like Whistle are pretty good. Black Pink have been managed to cross over in the West, even headlining Coachella in 2022. Also, at time of writing member Rose has a collab with Bruno Mars in the US charts. (Let's pause to acknowledge how combining her fans with his fans is like shooting fish in a barrel revenue-wise, while being bankrupt creativity wise. Still, the song's cute enough.) What I like most about Black Pink, and I know this seems very specific and potentially weird, is they're roughly the same height, giving their dance performances a uniformity SNSD could never achieve as there was about a foot's difference in height between tallest and shortest. It shouldn't be important, but in a weird way it makes them feel more _musiker arbeiterly_ - you now, like Kraftwerk.

I first disovered Aespa, another SM Entertainment girl group in 2022. Their early songs weren't presplendant with the sort of EDM drama songs that I like, however in 2024 they brought out two masterpieces, Supernova and Armageddon.

The K pop EDM songs I like tend to have lyrics that can be summed up as "I am better than you (and you can't handle it)". By contrast, Supernova is about having the energy of an unstable late-stage red supergiant star (which you also can't handle). The song's pretty decent, but the surreal video is excellent as our ladies of stellar nucleosynthesis cause CG mayhem across a Thai city.

Armageddon isn't quite as energetic as Supernova, but its got a loopy charm (best moment: an abrupt run of "bang chitty bang"s in the lyrics). The weird video is another winner.

It's hard to overemphasise the effect Supernova had on me. It felt like an apotheosis of the K pop sub-genre I like.

Very finally we come to Japanese expat Kpop group XG, and their weird minimalist hiphop outing Woke Up. Again the vid is pretty strange. It's not the sort of electro club banger that I seem to gravitate to, but it's a cool and detached song, and a bit out there. If nothing else, XG are certainly doing their bit for sales of dental accessories. XG have only been around for 18 months and sadly their other songs aren't nearly as interesting, but I'm hoping they might come out with more in future.

# Discussion

So that's my survey of K pop that I like. I should say that my listening isn't exhaustive; I wouldn't be suprised if was another two dozen songs that I would like if I knew they existed, but my interest doesn't quite reach the threshold for systematic investigation. The problem is I can't quite put myself through listening through hundreds of K pop songs I won't like to find more of the small fraction of songs that I will.

## Why do I listen to this stuff?

I often pose myself the question of why I remain interested in K pop when I haven't taken an interest in Western pop music in maybe 25 years. It's a question I have trouble answering.

The superficial answer is that I like the songs, but I'm not sure that the songs I do like are that different from Western pop songs. For example, the same Swedes to write US chart toppers also hawk their songs to Korean entertainment groups (a good example is SNSD's 2010 song Run Devil Run, which started life recorded by Kesha.)

### Othering

It's possible that K pop being "other" to my normal experience is an attraction. For example, I like XG's Woke Up because it's by a Japanese(!) K pop group rather than a US R&B group (if such now exist).

A concrete feature of this attractive otherness is that - as I understand it - South Korean society is conservative and conformist, and K pop groups stand in contrast to that. Indeed, I guess that it's that conformist culture that leads to young South Koreans being interested in K pop's non-conformity.

There are limits, however. Idols can perform as brashly as they like on stage, but they have to be demure and respectful at all other times, or face social approbrium. In this way K pop groups are more like Motown girl groups of the early 60s, working within strict cultural constraints.

### Am I a creepy uncle fan?

It's not escapted my notice that there's something a bit rum about a man pushing 50 taking an interest in K pop when the vast majority of the music is performed by young females under 30. I've mentioned that boy bands tend to release more anodyne fare as an explanation of why I'm not into them, but that's a bit convenient, isn't it?

This isn't a charge I can extricate myself from; I can't persuade you of the contents of my mind. But let me go through the motions: I will concede that K pop performers are easy on the eye, but idols really aren't my type. For one thing, the South Korean cosmetic surgery industry is so heavily subscribed, and beauty standards are so narrow, that there's a good deal fewer faces in Kpop than there are singers. (If you want to see plausibly human K idols, you have to time travel to the 1990s.)

So when I think about K pop idols, my overriding thoughts are "I hope they're being paid well", "I hope they're getting enough sleep", and "I hope no one else is going to commit suicide."

### Idol groups and the space race

This is something that occurred to me over the winter of 2024 when I got into Aespa and (unrelatedly) read some books about space history: there are some interesting parallels between idol groups and human spaceflight, as enterprises.

Now I realise that an astronaut's Right Stuff is very different to that of a K pop singer, but both occupations required a rigorous training and selection process that lasts years. That one group comprised military test pilots and the other group is exploited teenagers doesn't take away from the precision skills required for both disciplines.

You might contend that astronauts have it harder because their work is much more dangerous, but look at The Mercury 7 (one death) vs f(x) (one death) and Kara (one death). Kpop groups may not have to fear dying in a disintegrating spaceship, but the stakes remain high none the less.

And behind every kpop group, as with the Mercury 7, there are thousands of people working to make the endeavour succeed. For the original astronauts it was Nasa and the military industrial complex, but Kpop groups also have quite a bit going on. Managers, schedulers, song writers, publicists, music producers, costume makers, video directors, fan event coordinators, the list is infinite. Both endeavours require careful orchestration. It's said that the Apollo programme had 400,000 workers, but one random looking google search results suggests that 61,000 people work in K pop. Not quite the same, numbers wise, but perhaps more than you'd think.

Ok so these parallels are ultimately a bit silly; you could also conceivably compare K pop to any engineering project, or indeed to a military campaign, or running a hospital. But perhaps this gives an idea of _how_ I'm interested in K pop, even if it doesn't fully explain why.

# Other theories

I have noticed that my interest in K pop is not dissimilar to my interest in theatrical goth rock like Bauhaus or Sisters of Mercy. I mean, sure there are large stylistic differences, but it's ultimately they're both about drama and energy.

There's another parallel: my interest in K pop is perhaps a bit like gay men liking histrionic disco hits of the late 1970s. Now I'm not gay, and nor do I like those disco hits, but maybe there is an element of camp irony in my enjoyment of K pop. Back in the 90s I did obtain the complete works of the Spice Girls. Sort of as a joke, but I did genuinely enjoy some of those dorky songs.

Anyway, that's all the theorising I have about why I like K pop. Mystery solved?


### The future

I don't know what the future of K pop is, but I imagine I'll keep collecting a handful of songs I like sporadically over time, and that will be absolutely fine by me. And I'll continue to hold a perplexed admiration for K pop in a way that betrays my age, nationality, and cultural assumptions. Yess!
