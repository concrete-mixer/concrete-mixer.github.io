Survey of the following

- Folding Planets
- Zeus dude
- That Manuel Gottsching one

So when I was a young man, life was so simple that it basically boiled down to two axiomatic statements:

1. Ambient music is good.
2. New age music is terrible.

And to me the two genres were easy to distinguish. Over time and listening to dozens more albums I've found that 
In middle age I've found it's a bit more complicated than that.

# Definitions

As a teenager my working definition of new age music was music with the following qualities:

- harmonically simplistic
- made by hippies
- featured lots of Eastern accoutrements: eg tinkly bells
- had terrible album cover art
- featured terrible synth arrangements (see the Emulator cello samples on Constance Demby's Novus Magnificat)
- very much 1980s
- pan pipes
- Celtic crap (eg Enya)
- all about crystals and shit
- emotionally nice-nice but artistically void.

By contrast, Ambient was comprised of these aspects:

- invented by Brian Eno, so had a bit of intellectual cachet
- chill out music for when ravers flamed out in the early A.M.
- smart drugs and Terence McKenna
- more emotionally ambiguous - see Aphex Twin
- had sense of humour (KLF, the Orb)
- the way of the future


# But over time

Well, the more I heard, the more muddled things got. For starters, while teenage me saw 90s ambient as the recapitulation of 1970s music like Tangerine Dream and Jean Michel Jarre, early 20s me found that there weren't many 90s ambient albums that I actually liked. The KLF's Chill Out, and the Orb's first two albums are the only enduring classics in my mind. FSOL was too disjointed, Aphex Twin too gimmicky (it's true I love Selected Ambient Works 85-92, but it's a low-energy IDM album rather than ambient). Furthermore, actual listening of Eno's classics revealed that Discreet Music and Music for Airports was boring, and the only entry in his classic Ambient series that I care for is On Land (and the Laraaji album is, well, New Age!).

From the New Age end, things got more ambiguous. From around 1997 to 2007 (although also beyond) I discovered Krautrock (other than Tangerine Dream and Kraftwerk) and exploring these albums I found that from the late 1970s, all these bands became New Age (perhaps most prominently Michael Rother, for whom New Age music was an escape from Krautrock poverty).

But New Age itself was still terrible, right? That remained true for me until I began to discover albums that were both incontrovertibly New Age and undeniably good. Through Spotify I've encountered more of them. As penance for my earlier denigration, I feel compelled to discuss them here.

# Good New Age albums

(This list is not exhaustive, feel free to suggest your own!)

## The Harmonic Choir - Hearing Solar Winds

I first heard throat singing on KLF's Chill Out. The KLF-loving members of my social circle assumed the effect was a resonant filter put on the singer's voice, so finding out later that humans could actually make those sounds was pretty astonishing.

But it turns out that in the mid 1970s an American named David Hykes had assembled the Harmonic Choir, a ragtag group of overtonal singers.

Hearing Solar Winds was recorded in a French Church over several nights in 1983. It's just voices and reverb and the occasional tinging Asiatic chime (which I find unnecessary, but may have felt crucial for the singers, so I'm not going to condemn it outright).

Proceedings commence with Rainbow Voice, which is a single overtoned voice. The singing is minimal, focuses on harmonic generation. It reminds me of the numerous hours I've spent playing with a monophonic synth generating bass tones, sweeping the low-pass filter cutoff and enjoying the hearing harmonic tweak into existence, resonate, and fade back. Is it a spiritual experience? I'm not sure, but if you absolutely have to label an experience like that spiritual, I guess I would allow it. While I gradually learned (if not wholly) that filter-swept drones are pretty old-hat, if you're a human who can do it, you should go for it. Here the singer (Hykes perhaps) goes for gold, and gets there.

"Multiplying Voices At the Heart of the Body of Sound" (not an early Tangerine Dream track title, but is indistinguishable from one), as the title suggests, introduces multiple voices, singing the same tone but slightly detuned to create beats. The harmonic ambiguity is of this is great. Eventually the voices resolve into chords, and it's not sappy, it feels kind of right.

Arc Descents - again as the title suggests, features voices slowly descending, falling out of and into tune gracefully.

The strangely modernly-titled Gravity Waves is a 2001ish soundscape of gradually evolving harmonies.

The longest track is Telescoping, where the voices ranging through one another in a slowly changing, hypnotic way.

On Ascending and Descending the voices range up and down in a way similar to the opener Rainbow Voice. It's slightly reminiscent of the Popul Vuh track that opens Herzog's Nosferatu. Then the sound fades away.

What makes this album so good? I think part of the key is that it's powered solely by the human voice, which makes it timeless. The voices are suspended in space too, and the church's reverb kind leaves them floating in eternity. The motivations of the choir are New Age and the sound is warm and positive, yet none of these elements are in any way a detriment.

The album that most reminds me of Hearing Solar Winds is Tangerine Dream's Zeit, and not just for the track names: both albums are long, and largely structureless. It's worth comparing the albums too to highlight my New Age/Ambient divide (I wouldn't really call Zeit Ambient - it's too serious - but it's more on that side of the spectrum). Whereas Zeit's objective is to explore the subject of time on its own terms (ie without reference to Eastern spiritual practice), with whatever sounds they can, Hykes comes to proceedings with the healing power of an Eastern overtonal singing circle. This makes the difference for me: Zeit is an unconstrainedly Great Album, whereas Hearing Solar Winds is merely a Great New Age album.

I'll concede it's an imprecise comparison, and assumes that there's something wrong with Eastern Spiritual practice. It's not that I think that Eastern spirituality is bunk, exactly, but I think it's a well best dipped from sparingly, not something to build your whole being around.

All that aside (and I feel bad for having said it), Hearing Solar Winds has helped me to slumber on many a night, and I unreservedly salute Hykes for his genius.

## Steve Hillage - Rainbow Dome Musick (1979)

Former Gong member Steve Hillage, with and wife/partner Miquette Giraudy were previously in the prog-hippie band Gong. Hillage and Giraudy provided some of the more contemplative electronic moments in Gong's music (when they weren't banging on about bloody pothead pixies).

Rainbow Dome Musick was "Recorded for the Rainbow Dome at the Festival for Mind-Body-Spirit Olympia London April 21-29. 1979.", which should give you an idea. Things start with the sound of water trickling into a pool, which, on playing back just now encouraged my wife to use the bathroom. Other this sound and electric piano and synth waft in gently and lovingly. Gradually a spiraling sequencer comes in to play. Things waft about celestially, with Hillage's guitar making an appearance.

Four Ever Rainbow starts with a ting sound sound and some raspy bass monosynth harmonic twiddling. There's some catlike sines and a plinky heavy delayed synth. It's very New Age, but more shockingly, it sounds like the Orb, and this is not a coincidence: Rainbow Dome Musick was a disc spun by the Orb's LX Paterson and the KLF's Jimmy Cauty when they (re)discovered ambient in the late 80s. Indeed, Hillage and Giraudy collaborated with the Orb on the wonderful Orb track Blue Room. All of this suggests the boundary between ambient and New Age is pretty porous.

## Inter-dimensional music - Iasos (1975)

[Iasos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iasos_(musician)) is an American-Greek New Ager, and this album from the mid 1970s feels much later than that, because it contains many New Age/ambient tropes. The music is clear and peaceful without being cloying, and there's a fresh, bright openness to the music. The arrangement is reasonably jazzy, with flute, guitar, and piano, garnished with synth washes and plenty of space in the arrangements. It's a musical document that's both utterly infused by the New Age, but not dogmatically bound to it. To me the standout track is Rainbow Canyon, which has a Gongish, Krautrocky vibe. Lots of shimmering slide or pedal-steel guitar.

## Ashra - Blackouts

Ashra started life as the Krautrock band Ashra Tempel, who produced some remarkable albums in the early 1970s (including a collaboration with Timothy Leary?!). By 1977 the group's creative powerhouses Klaus Schulze and Manuel Gottsching had gone their own ways; Schulze had embarked on a successful solo career as a synth guru (curiously, despite his music being essentially My Thing, I've never been moved by it), while Gottsching rebranded as Ashra, a banner for his solo work. The title of the first Ashra album, New Age of Earth (1976), gives a clear indication of Gottsching's intentions, but the followup album Blackouts is the one I wish to include in my "good" New Age list.

The first track, "77 Slightly Delayed", is a genial piece, synth-propelled and with interest maintained by Garcia-esque guitar. (This track is in the "style" known as Berlin School, which basically boils down to a synth sequence plus a human-played solo. Initially pioneered by Tangerine Dream with their first sequencer-driven track Phaedra, the Berlin-residing artists Edgar Froese, Klaus Schulze, and Manuel Gottsching elaborated on the style through the 70s - Froese mostly on his solo albums, while Schulze and Gottsching made it their primary modus operandi. Schulze's Berlin School sound is (to my mind) anaemic and dull, but Gottsching gave it a bit more variation and texture (esp on what's arguably his best album, [E2-E4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E2-E4) from 1981).

Track 2, Midnight on Mars, is a gentle space jazz outing. Don't Trust The Kids, sounds more like Air than anything else? The track is attached to its followup, Blackouts, which erupts in a blaze of guitar solo.Shuttlecock is a geometric spiral of multiple guitars and afro rhythms. Concluding the album is the more straightforwardly New Agey Lotus Part I - IV, which shuffles around reasonably cheerfully, although some dissonance is allowed in at one point.

To be honest, New Age of Earth is more straightforwardly New Age than Blackouts, but because of that it's less interesting. Is it New Age enough? Well, if you compare it to the primordial fire of Ash Ra Tempel's first album, it is, yes. If you compare it to something Hearts of Spacey, not so much. Interestingly, the Ashra album following BLackouts, Correlations (1979), was a more rock(!) affair, so it's almost like over the course of three albums Gottsching recanted his New Age swerve.

Blackouts then, represents an imperfect example of Krautrock trend of evolving from experimental rock to a much softer, more appealing and largely New Age sound. Tangerine Dream, Michael Rother, Popul Vuh (earlier than most), and Cluster (on New Age label Sky Records!) all went there. Those that didn't largely faded into obscurity. Or were Kraftwerk. It was a strangely weak end to arguably the most fertile art music movement in the late 20th Century. On the other hand, if it paid for mortgages, I'm not going to argue with that.

## Enya - Watermark (1988)

I adored Orinoco Flow when I first heard it, and the rest of Watermark when I eventually caught up with it. I didn't think much of Enya's followup, Shepherd Moons, though, and haven't bothered to hear anything else she's done. 

Watermark is a joyous, exploratory, open-feeling album. Does it make me grit my teeth to say I still like it? Yes! But I can't deny it.

# Rounding it out

Thinking about these albums, my initial teenage thesis that New Age Good, Ambient Bad, is clearly insufficient. Can we make better definitions?

Ambient being a more elusive genre, let's define it broadly and non-specifically as "low intensity music". You can add a lot more defining characterisitcs, but I think this definition is just specific enough to cage most music people would think of as ambient, while distinguishing it from genres few ambient makers and listeners would consider ambient (classical Symphonies, hard bop Jazz, black metal, and so forth).

(I should point out I don't consider this an academic-grade definition, but a useful rule of thumb.)

With this definition of Ambient, New Age sits as a sub-genre where the intent it focused on spirituality, wellbeing and transcendence. 90s post-rave ambient has some crossover with New Age, but plenty of ambient music made before or since does not.

As for my original "New Age music sucks thesis", my attitude has changed somewhat. I still feel the New Age movement as a whole is misguided at best and shonky at worst, but it has clearly attracted some pretty thoughtful musical practitioners. As with most enduring ideas (socialism, conservatism, materialsm), there's a kernel of value there, but it's not the whole story. I find it easier to respect art created without any underlying dogma. Or if there is a dogma, it's related to the art itself. In concrete terms, I do think Christian Metal is
