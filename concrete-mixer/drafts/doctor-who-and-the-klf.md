It will seem strange to any reader that I'd write a survey combining Doctor Who and the KLF. I mean, there's one obvious link between the two subjects, but to elaborate on both at length would be a bit strange.

The strange fact of it is that Doctor Who and the KLF are linked in _my_ head, and I'm writing all this crap from my perspective. So that's how it is. You can always skip ahead.

# Doctor Who

As you'll be dimly aware, Doctor Who is a long-running British TV science fiction serial about an alien (known only as "the Doctor") who travels through time in a vehicle shaped like a phone booth, called the TARDIS. The Doctor ) usually travels with "companions" - mostly gormless humans but occasionally other aliens, robots, whoever happens along, really. The companions help to elaborate each story by listening to exposition, acting as greek chorus, and regularly getting into peril. The other major element to the show is the character playing the Doctor changes regularly, usually every three seasons or so. This first happened because the original actor became too frail to continue, and rather than conclude the show, the Doctor was designated an alien who had multiple lives and could regenerate a new body. A new actor was appointed, and the show continued.

The series began in 1963 as an opportunity to surreptitiously teach history lessons to children (Doctor Who hangs out with Genghis Kahn! Doctor Who meets the Aztecs!) but encounters aliens proved more popular, especially the ridiculous-looking Daleks - basically screechy authoritarian cyborgs on wheels. Because the British love traditions, the show quickly became a revered institution, and its first incarnation lasted until 1989.

I have a much-older cousin who told me she liked to show me Doctor Who when I was really little, so when I got scared she got to comfort me, which she enjoyed. Looking back this seems more than a little psychologically dubious, but to be honest this was pretty benign compared to how she turned out as an adult. Anyway, my first experience of Doctor who was as a pre-schooler, at the very limit of memory.

The overriding thing you have to understand about 1963-89 Doctor Who - known as "Classic" Who - is that it was cheap. The special effects were not only not that special, you can barely describe them as effects. Two examples: a fierce alien amoeba monster from the mid 70s which was a pile of bubblewrap with green paint slopped on. Example 2: a late 80s Cyberman warrior wearing cricket gloves spraypainted silver.

Doctor Who was produced by the BBC, then (and largely still) a watchword for broadcasting worthiness and quality. Doctor Who's budgets were simultaneously embarrassingly small, yet to the BBC execs eye-wateringly lavish.

If the effects weren't up  to much, what was the chief attraction of the show. As a kid it was the outlandish spectacle and adventure, but as an adult, it's a bit more subtle. I enjoy the stagey theatricality of the performances, the abundance of British eccentricity, and the glorious sound design of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop.

It's said that your favourite Doctor is the first one you saw, and this is true for me. My doctor was Tom Baker, who gave the role a genuine alien mania in my view hasn't been topped. He was replaced in the role by Peter Davidson, who played the doctor as more youthful but also more fragile. He was decent, but under his tenure the show began to lose steam

As mentioned, Doctor Who was cancelled in 1989. Through much of the show's first run, it was constantly getting upstaged by US science fiction shows screened by rival network ITV. The writing on shows like Star Trek (possibly) and Battlestar Galactica (definitely) was inferior, but their production value was much higher, which made their surface level escapism more plausible and therefore attractive. By the 1980s Doctor Who was becoming decidedly creaky, with a drop in story quality and audience ratings dropping. The unhappy tenure of Colin Baker in main role started a slide that a subsequent uptick in fortunes wasn't unable to correct, and the show was cancelled in 1989. 

## My Who fandom and nerd culture generally

Who was big in my life from when I was 5 to 7. It abruptly stopped playing on NZ TV after Peter Davison's first season, and didn't resume for another 3 years. Rather than continue where it left off, broadcasts recommenced from the time of the third Doctor, played by Jon Pertwee. Pertwee's portrayal was different again from Tom Baker's and Davidson's, and the stories were darker and more lurid. I was totally up for it. Through the mid 80s the show was broadcast continuously, and we eventually caught up with Colin Baker's and Sylvester McCoy's tenures in 1988.

Through this later period (when I was aged ~10 - 13) I went mad for Who. It was perhaps the "peak nerd" point in my life. I think my enthusiasm for Doctor Who (and my general conservative dullness) was responsible for the breakdown of my relationship with then my best friend. In a way it's lucky Doctor Who got cancelled I might have spiralled further out of control.

These days nerdiness is endlessly pandered to for commercial gain, and when my nation's annual "pop culture" (read comic books and anime) convention rumbles in to town, there's the inevitable and unedifying spectacle of out of shape, rainbow-haired persons dressed in anime cosplay gear shambling around town. I feel like that could have been me, had such horrors been in vogue in the late 80s and early 90s.

You may think, "where's the harm?" Well, I think most things should be done moderation, and in this scenario my definition of moderation is: don't play dressups. I'm not saying you can never embrace your inner nerd, but before you do so (and perhaps after, for good measure) give it a good talking to and maybe a bit of a slap.

Why the aggression? Well, I just think nerdiness does have a level of psychological pathology - insecurity, timidity, a desire for wish-fulfillment. And while I indulge in silliness like JJBA now and then, I think it's healthy to maintain perspective.

# Enter the KLF

In November 1988, as it was sliding into oblivion, Doctor Who marked its 25th anniversary. Someone at TVNZ was a fan of the show, as a whole season of Doctor Who got broadcast, with stories from each of the Doctors to that time. This was all very grand, but a more memory in my head was the advent of the song Doctorin' the Tardis by the Timelords.

This filthy novelty single featured the Doctor Who theme backed by the so-called Glitter Beat. It was a shambling horror of the song. I didn't know who the Timelords were, and didn't care. The point was that Doctor Who was getting a bit of attention. I wasn't the only one keen: the single topped the charts in the UK, and in my homeland of New Zealand.

And then I saw the video. Being a disgusting fanboy, I expected the video to feature classic clips from the programme and be (somehow) highly reverential. Instead, the vid mostly featured terrible homemade daleks being run over by an ancient American cop car. Not only was the video not what I wanted to see, and not only was it embarrassing, after watching it I felt vaguely humiliated by it.

It was years before I understood what the hell I'd witnessed, but for a moment I'd transcended my rather boring, staid, conservative, goody-two-shoes view of things, and entered (well, stood in the doorway of and scrunched up my face at) a wider, wilder, weirder world.

Where to start with the KLF? Well, definitely [The KLF: Chaos, Magic and the Band who Burned a Million Pounds](https://johnhiggs.com/books/the-klf/) by John Higgs. The [KLF wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_KLF) is pretty comprehensive too. I have to write something introductory about them, though, so let's say this: at a crossroads in time and space on January 1st 1987 Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty decided, under the influence of the Illuminatus! trilogy, to form a hip-hop band called the Justified Ancients of Mu-Mu. Cauty took the alias Rockman Rock, while Drummond took the moniker Kingboy D.

The JAMs (as they abbreviated themselves) they spent their first year making strange and strangely inept hiphop. Things came to ahead at the end of the year when they got into a legal spat with Abba over the JAMs flagrant copyright violation of the song Dancing Queen. The outcome of this sorry chapter was that all copies of the JAMs album [1987 (What the Fuck is Going on?)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1987_(What_the_Fuck_Is_Going_On%3F)) in a Swedish field. The start of 1988 brought the marginally more polished Who Killed the Jamms? And on May 23 came Doctorin' the Tardis. The song was originally intended to be a house arrangment of the Doctor Who theme, but only the swung Glitter Beat would work for them, and they eventually leaned into that, piling on a Sweet sample and a dalek Harry Enfield's Loadsamoney character's catchphrase processed to sound like a dalek.

Unlike the 1987 novelty single Star Trekkin' - which I'd also been amused by - Doctorin' the Tardis wasn't really about Doctor Who at all (aside from its wonderful theme music), and certainly not about the show's 25th Anniversary.

Even so, there is something Doctor Who-like about Drummond and Cauty. Like the Doctor with his tardis, they too have a vehicle, their car (named Ford Timelord for the single). With the proceeds from Doctorin' the Tardis, the JAMs, now renamed to the KLF (what the acronym stands for was never revealed) decided to make a road movie in Spain.

I haven't explained what Drummond and Cauty were about. They've never exactly _said_ what it was all about, but there seems to have been elements of situationism, anarchy, pisstaking, pagan mysticism, and a genuine affection for rock and roll, and latter-day pop.

What else to say about them? Well, the road movie (christened the White Room and laced with a cryptic mythology of the KLF's own devising) never got finished, but the KLF started releasing genuine house (and arguably early trance) singles. In 1989 the White Room soundtrack got an ambient mix called Chill Out, which recast ambient music as the soothing come-down handmaiden to the rave generation. As far as I'm aware, Chill Out was the first album of the new ambient music movement that lasted into the mid 90s.

By mid 1990 the KLF had released three singles in their Pure Trance series: What Time is Love, 3am Eternal, and Last Train to Trancentral. From mid 1990 the group released retooled mixes of these singles, adding vocals, rapping and a slicker, more commercial production. The new singles were major hits in the UK and across Europe, and the group released a reworking of the White Room soundtrack. During this time the group also held an elaborate happening at the summer solstice on the island of Jura,  where a wicker man was ceremoniously burned before an audience of bemused music journalists. After this manic period of success it had all gotten a bit too much for Cauty and Drummond, and the KLF spectacularly imploded in early 1992.

I'd like to say that I'd spent 1991 avidly following the KLF's shenanigans, but in truth I was only dimly aware they existed, and much more enthused about a dinosaur named Jean Michel Jarre. It wasn't until I was at university that I first heard Chill Out, and I only became aware of the KLF's story, upon hearing episode 48 of [The Story of Pop](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00yrr89), a BBC radio documentary series (the BBC often being my primary source of learning about anything) broadcast in 1995.

By then, the KLF was no more. But Drummond and Cauty's shenigans continued as they moved from the music industry to the art world, founding the K Foundation to perpetuate pranks on the art world and then eventually all humanity, when they filmed themselves burning (probably) 1 million pounds in 1994. There was a further outing in 1997 in the form of 2K, where What Time is Love? was wheeled out one last time to support striking Liverpool dock workers. Gradually the activity petered out to a base level: of Bill Drummond coming with a new scheme every couple of years; with fans (well, this fan anyway) feeling a sense of cosy nostalgia tinged with regret that nothing as heady as the KLF's glory years were likely to happen again.

# The rebirth of Who(ol)

While the end of Who allowed adolescent me to move on, I retained some fondness for the show, and periodically re-watched 70s and 80s VHS tapes and DVDs. It all seemed more quaint and silly now, although there was still much to enjoy.

An attempt to USify Doctor Who occurred in the mid 90s with a TV movie that, while not terrible, wasn't great. Then, in 2004 (I think) the BBC announced it was restarting the series. I was fairly nonplussed by this (I think "why now?" was my main thought), but I thought I'd give it a go. Eventually the first episode was broadcast in NZ and my response was "nah".

New Who never engaged me, because although the scenario, plotting and characters were roughly the same, the feel was all wrong.  The bad practical special effects had been replaced by bad CG, which felt insulting rather than endearing. Similarly, the pioneering electronic theme music was now rendered by a synth orchestra (or a real orchestra that sounded blandly synthetic). A theme (and incidental music) with an arrangement more in keeping with the stark weirdness of the original, and production design and effects were more more cannily stylistic (even in CG), would have improved the feel.

But these differences are fairly superficial. The approach to story and characterisation was also off. Whereas the Doctor's relationship with his companions was previously platonic (the Doctor being an alien and all), the New Doctor was a passionate, romantic hero, played by younger actors. Not coincidentally, this approach brought more female fans to the show. I guess that's a Good Thing, but it also made Who a bit cheesier and soap operatic, which is another repelling factor for me.

(I should add that I find the phenomenon of a female Doctor Who fanbase a bit frustrating: 13 year old me would have been grateful to be able to use Doctor Who as a way to relate to girls, because Lord knows I was struggling otherwise.)

More generally, New Who is less a vehicle for SF entertainment, than a stage for demonstrating diversity, equity, and inclusion. I'm not against these things in principle, and I suspect that in order to get funding and be resurrected, New Who's show-runners had to put these principles first and foremost. But the often simplistic, half-arsed execution of DEI has consistently undermined these goals. I'm convinced that if you treat an issue with thoughtful nuance it will get a good reception. But if you hammer people over the head with it, at best you'll get a lot of eye-rolling, and at worst you'll garner outright hostility.

Around the same time that New Who appeared, the BBC's rival ITV brought out Primeval, a show where various sciencey folk had to contend with animals from different prehistoric eras appearing randomly in modern times via time-spanning wormholes. Although the show most certainly wasn't high art, I felt Primeval was conducted in a spirit much closer to Old Who: its makers did get the tone right. Primeval only lasted a few seasons, but it managed to tell its story in a satisfying way.

In fairness to New Who, though, I should point out that all I can honestly say of it is that I've tried watching a handful of episodes, and have been repelled by every single one.

## Neo KLF

In recent years there has been a sporadic uptick in KLF activity. In 2017 a sort of festival was held in Toxteth, and a new novel was published. In 2021 the KLF undeleted their back catalogue and put it on Spotify, with a new website launched. But there has been no new music, which is what this fan at least really craves.

Should there be music? Well, probably not. Time has moved on, and Rockman and Kingboy are wise enough to know that they have nothing more to say that hasn't already been said. Over at the BBC, however, Doctor Who will continue to get made and continue to be a bit shit, a shadow of how relevant it was in its 60s and 70s heyday.
